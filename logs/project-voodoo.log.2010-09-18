[23:20] <DMoult> k, 45 seconds, minesweeper agian
[23:22] <sinc> oh btw, usually people like to flash those files without having sim card or sd card inside the phone
[23:22] <sinc> so just to be safe, I would remove those first and then go back into download mode
[23:22] <DMoult> do i have to switch off phone to remove them?
[23:22] <sinc> yup
[23:23] <DMoult> er
[23:23] <DMoult> it says 'do not turn off target'
[23:23] <DMoult> what does that mean
[23:23] <sinc> nothing at the moment
[23:23] <DMoult> do i have to pull battery
[23:23] <DMoult> power button doesn't seem to work
[23:23] <sinc> since you aren't downloading anything into your phone yet
[23:23] <sinc> yes, pull the battery off
[23:25] #project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/69 o/0 h/0 v/0 n/69 b/0 e/0 I/0]
[23:27] <sinc> let me know when you have everything downloaded and the phone is back in the download mode without sim card and sd card
[23:28] <DMoult> can't seem to get into download mode now :/
[23:30] #project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/69 o/0 h/0 v/0 n/69 b/0 e/0 I/0]
[23:30] <sinc> for me this method always works; first press the volume down button, then home and finally power, always in that order
[23:31] <sinc> if you press the power button first it won't go into download mode
[23:31] <DMoult> jusnothing...
[23:32] <DMoult> endless rebooting
[23:32] <sinc> pull the battery and try again :-/
[23:33] <DMoult> amdoing so
[23:33] <DMoult> how many times should the first splash screen show
[23:33] <DMoult> before hitting download mode
[23:33] <sinc> it should go into that mode immediately
[23:34] <DMoult> it's just shpwing splash screen, black, repeat
[23:34] <sinc> do you have the usb plugged in?
[23:34] <DMoult> no
[23:34] <sinc> k
[23:35] #project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/69 o/0 h/0 v/0 n/69 b/0 e/0 I/0]
[23:35] <sinc> just to make absolutely clear, you are pressing vol down button, right?
[23:35] <DMoult> ywwes;['
[23:35] <DMoult> yes
[23:36] <sinc> really strange, since it worked just fine before
[23:36] <DMoult> could battery level affec tit?
[23:36] <DMoult> currently at like 5% i think
[23:36] <sinc> that could be it, leave it to charge for maybe 30 minutes and try again
[23:39] <DMoult> btw, will the fact that i have voodoo installed impact anything?
[23:39] <DMoult> i thought generally you have to disable voodoo before flashing

[23:40] <rafyvitto> dmoult, did you manage to flash you device, i was afk =]
[23:41] <DMoult> rafyvitto, nope, still fighting with getting into download mode
[23:41] <rafyvitto> fark...
[23:41] <DMoult> and only 70% of the JM8 downloaded so far lol
[23:41] <rafyvitto> oh ok
[23:41] <DMoult> currently suspecting lack of battery, so leaving it to charge for a bit before i resume fighting for download mode
[23:41] <DMoult> got it once, but then rebooted so i could remove my sim/sd card, and now can't get back to it :(
[23:42] <DMoult> but yeah, can i flash without disabling voodoo?
[23:43] <rafyvitto> sure
[23:43] <rafyvitto> flashing it will put it back to stock OEM settings
[23:43] <DMoult> If you forgot to read this giant documentation and installed another Kernel or Firmware without disabling lagfix first, well… that’s too bad, but it’s repairable by 2 options:
[23:43] <DMoult> ?
[23:43] <rafyvitto> liek when you got it outod the box
[23:43] <DMoult> Re-installing Voodoo by flashing the Kernel with Odin: Your ext4 data will be back if the previous procedure dind’t format DATA partition
[23:43] <DMoult> Starting into recovery and wipe data. Warning, like it says, you’ll loose your personal data. If you don’t have backup, use this option in last resort.
[23:43] <DMoult> hm, ok

[23:46] <DMoult> do i need to download the JM8 and JM4 files as well?
[23:46] <sinc> those are in that bigger file that you are downloading
[23:46] <DMoult> k

[23:53] <Venim> DMoult: did you change the android.policy thing
[23:53] <DMoult> Venim, don't even know what that is
[23:53] <Venim> nvm then
[23:54] <DMoult> what exactly is adb btw, is it a computer thing or on the phone?
[23:54] <DMoult> i always assumed it was from the phone
[23:54] <rafyvitto> dmoult, you need to do it manually
[23:54] <Venim> computer
[23:54] <DMoult> so can i hook phone up via usb and boot it to download via abd?
[23:54] <DMoult> adb*
[23:54] <Venim> yes
[23:54] <Jasonyump> Hey guys, anyone else notice any lag in 3d gaming with the voodoo kernel. 1.5?
[23:54] <DMoult> what is this adb?
[23:54] <rafyvitto> yes but it has to be in userland or recvery
[23:54] <rafyvitto> recovery*
[23:54] <sinc> it's part of android sdk

[23:55] <rafyvitto> jason, you a captivate user right?
[23:55] <sinc> doesn't seem to work for him
[23:56] <DMoult> it worked once, then i pulled battery to remove sim/sd card, then now it won't work again
[23:56] <rafyvitto> you might have to reflash your second bootloader =]
[23:56] <DMoult> it's dodgy too, i see the first samsung galaxy s splash screen about 4-5 times before the yellow icon shows
[23:56] <rafyvitto> but its very very risky...
[23:56] <Jasonyump> Yeah captivate user Rafyvitto
