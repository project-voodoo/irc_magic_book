[00:20] <solipsism82> Yeah summer tires are usless in anything below 4 degrees celsius
[00:20] <solipsism82> so even without snow they are very dangerous
[00:20] <rafyvitto> cause he bought a house, and coulndt handle both
[00:20] <solipsism82> ah yeah

[00:21] <solipsism82> his payments go up and his house is worth less every month
[00:21] <rafyvitto> he was paying like 400+ a month, plus the house=impossible

[02:15] <Unhelpful> curio_: so i convert during startup and things go all wrong after conversion success, but i do it from recovery mode w/ the same script, wait a bit, and restart, and all is well. i'm thinking this might not be unrelated to your issue w/ vibrant and forcing CPU speeds?
[02:15] <Unhelpful> either that or grinding on CPU and storage gets it nice and hot, then it runs the cpufreq script and explodes. :/

[02:29] <Unhelpful> i still have a suspicion that things go wrong when it starts the cpufreq script right after conversion.
[02:29] <curio_> what starts cpufreq ?
[02:30] @#project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/64 o/1 h/0 v/0 n/63 b/0 e/0 I/0]
[02:30] <curio_> it's in your second init part ?
[02:30] <curio_> to set cpu parameters ?
[02:31] <Unhelpful> loading custom frequency/voltage tables, and it's in the system init, just after voodoo runs.
[02:31] <Unhelpful> and the phone is *definitely* noticeably warm right after voodoo completes conversion ;)
[02:31] <curio_> hahah
[02:32] <Unhelpful> just thinking that maybe stressing it and then telling it to lower voltages and raise clocks is maybe not good
[02:32] <curio_> that's almost suprirising because when you run tar commands with time
[02:32] <curio_> you see that the cpu used is very light
[02:32] <curio_> i/o don't consume much cpu on SGS
[02:32] <Unhelpful> most time is i/o wait i'd think
[02:32] <curio_> ya
[02:33] <Unhelpful> but possibly the flash heats up since stage 2 is basically a bunch of writes?

[02:35] Hoffa (~Hoffa@c-71-204-164-17.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) joined #project-voodoo.
[02:35] <curio_> i would say, if changing cpu parameters,  anytime  to oc or uv produce weirdness, that's because it's not stable with these settings
[02:36] <Unhelpful> well, stable settings for a hot cpu are different from those for a cool one.
[02:36] <curio_> lol
[02:36] <Unhelpful> that's why i want to get AVS working :)
[02:37] <curio_> stables settings for a cold CPU that are not stable when it's hot aren't stable settings at all
[02:37] <Unhelpful> yes, they are, actually, because what a cpu is capable of depends on its voltage and temperature
[02:37] <Hoffa> Guys, is it confirmed that the voodoo lagfix is the best one out there?
[02:37] <Hoffa> I'm too nervous to run it on the Fascinate, though
[02:38] <Unhelpful> these both change the propagation delay in gates, and that's what makes things unstable, when a signal hasn't passed through all of the gates by the next clock.
[02:39] <curio_> Hoffa, i'm not the right person to answer to this question :p
[02:39] <Hoffa> Hah, yes, I recall the "banter" :)
[02:39] <Hoffa> Really impressed with your work, man.  Been following it.  Will absolutely donate when Fascinate is supported. Please keep it up!
[02:39] <curio_> sure, it will be ported to Fascinate

[02:40] <curio_> i'm working on merging all kernels into one to simplify ports
[02:40] <wArri> curio_ thats sounds nice in theory but isnt there slightly different hardware in each sgs?
[02:40] <Hoffa> I wish I had enough knowledge to help you out.  I downloaded the SDK but I'm nowhere near talented enough to look at this stuff.

[02:41] <curio_> wArri, in practice difference in sources are very small. the biggest difference is the boot logo in a big 13MB .h file :D

[02:43] <curio_> Unhelpful, you mean during the oc phase itself, the CPU is less stable ?
[02:43] <curio_> Unhelpful, but after settings are set into the kernel, everything is alright again ?
[02:44] <curio_> does anyone has an experience with a script transforming irc logs into nice html pages ?
[02:44] <curio_> i've seen several examples but none were very readable
[02:45] @#project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/67 o/1 h/0 v/0 n/66 b/0 e/0 I/0]

[02:47] <Hoffa> reversible root + recovery via clockwork mod...are what I'm waiting for to be released for the Fascinate.  I bet it'll take less time than it did for the Incredible.
[02:47] <Frd^> curio_: what kind script you need
[02:47] <Frd^> i could wrote one for you =)
[02:47] <curio_> log to html transformer
[02:47] <curio_> yeah that's not to terrible to code
[02:48] <curio_> something that allow a nice navigation and searching would be a big + !
[02:48] <curio_> or you know, a directory listing and text as monospace can do the job :p
[02:49] <curio_> how can we make irc logs useful
[02:49] <Frd^> yeah. or you import log to sql and make frontend on that
[02:49] <curio_> for somebody searching valuable informations in it
[02:49] <Frd^> then you can do all search and navigatio on that
[02:50] <curio_> well, i'll avoid sql if possible, because logs tend to become big quite fast !
[02:50] @#project-voodoo (+ctn) : [m/67 o/1 h/0 v/0 n/66 b/0 e/0 I/0]
[02:50] <curio_> :)
[02:50] <Frd^> you ment to keep them on flat?
[02:50] <curio_> if possible, why not
[02:51] <Unhelpful> curio_: no, i mean that stressing the system and getting it very very hot before might make it quite less tolerable of low voltages or high clocks.
[02:51] <curio_> Frd^, here is the logging format : http://perso.curio.be/android/project-voodoo.log.2010-09-19
[02:51] <Frd^> hmm, those search are paint int the ass on flatfiles.

[02:53] Voodoo_logger joined #project-voodoo.
[02:53] <Unhelpful> oh, and another reason to get more room on initramfs is so i can put more stuff in that may not be for voodoo - all the utils i might need to debug anything, etc.
[02:53] <Frd^> curio_: if i make you custom script for logging
[02:53] <curio_> Frd^, http://schooltool.pov.lt/irclogs/
[02:53] <curio_> Frd^, a tcl script ?
[02:53] <Frd^> yeha
[02:54] <curio_> yes but why is it needed ?
[02:54] #project-voodoo: mode change '+o Voodoo_logger' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
[02:54] <curio_> i ajusted the log flags
[02:54] <curio_> http://schooltool.pov.lt/irclogs/%23schooltool.2010-09-08.log.html : not so much readable i thik. what's your opinion ?

[02:55] <curio_> i'm searching a busy days ^

[02:58] <curio_> this one is already a bit more readable : http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/irc/irclog/2005-02-22.html
[02:58] <curio_> but the listing is scary ^^http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/irc/irclog/
[02:58] <curio_> ohh check that : http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/
[02:59] <Unhelpful> hrm, nope, pulling my external SD card stops the OC script from running, and it still crashes after conversion during boot
[02:59] <O_oo> http://irclogger.com/padrino/2010-09-18
[02:59] <Unhelpful> something about the environment in which the script runs is different, maybe...
[02:59] <Frd^> i think that could me made. line year.month ->days under it

[03:00] <curio_> nice O_oo !
[03:00] <DMKrow> hello all, is this a fair place for asking questions about recovering from data corruption? (Voodoo JAC beta1) - can't see SD card
[03:00] <O_oo> http://github.com/cschneid/irclogger
[03:00] <O_oo> c'est celui la
[03:00] <curio_> 01:00 IRCLogger was written in Sinatra, an awesome Ruby microframework. The source code is available on GitHub.
[03:01] <curio_> hmm my host is php-only i think but i can run this on a subdomain on my linux box
[03:02] <curio_> none propose a search feature
[03:02] <curio_> strange nobody had the idea, everybody relies on google parsing it ?
[03:03] <Frd^> those search from flatfiles take lots of cpu
[03:03] <curio_> yeah your're right
[03:03] <curio_> that's why you talked about sql
[03:04] <Frd^> yep
[03:04] Nick change: rafyvitto|afk -> rafyvitto
[03:04] <rafyvitto> im back =]
[03:04] <curio_> since the beginning, my irc log for #project-voodoo is 3.2MB
[03:04] <curio_> and the beginning is quite not old at all ^^
[03:05] <curio_> hey rafyvitto
[03:05] <curio_> i have 25MB in sql in this cheap plan
[03:05] <curio_> raw data + index will take 25MB very soon
[03:05] <curio_> we talk too much :D
[03:05] <Frd^> yeah
[03:06] <curio_> http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-soc/ << nice presentation
[03:06] <curio_> yeahh
[03:06] <curio_> and search is facilitated
[03:06] <Frd^> yeah
[03:07] <curio_> too bad their logs are empty !!
[03:07] <curio_> oh they talk here : http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-soc/
[03:07] <curio_> hmm, not bad !
[03:07] <Unhelpful> initramfs lzma boots, yay. :)
[03:07] <Frd^> yeah nice layput
[03:07] <curio_> hahaha Unhelpful !
[03:08] <Unhelpful> it's not available for the whole kernel on arm yet, sadly. :(
[03:08] <curio_> too bad !!!
[03:08] <curio_> On #perl6 we had the need for a irc log that could easily be accessed with a web interface. So I wrote one.
[03:08] <curio_> It consists of an IRC bot based on Bot::Basicbot that logs into a (mysql) database, and a web frontend that displays the data nicely.
[03:08] <curio_> oops ^
[03:08] <curio_> Frd^, do you know perl ? :)
[03:09] <Frd^> yeah
[03:09] <curio_> yeah !! :)

[03:10] <curio_> do you think you can seperate it from mysql and use flat files instead ?
[03:11] <Frd^> need to check it ou
[03:12] <curio_> i'm still searching if it produces static html files or not
[03:12] <curio_> lol
[03:12] <curio_> i'ts in gci mode
[03:12] <curio_> pffff
[03:13] <curio_> no cache, nothing
[03:13] <Frd^> hmm hmm..
[03:14] <curio_> hmm yes
[03:14] <curio_> the "filtering by nick" feature is very good
[03:15] <Unhelpful> curio_: yeah but a *lot* of space is in your initramfs ;)
[03:15] <Frd^> curio_: yeah that is easy on sql
[03:16] <Frd^> INSERT INTO irclog (channel, day, nick, timestamp, line
[03:16] <DMKrow> does the Voodoo fix require altering the partition table of mmcblkp0?
[03:16] <Frd^> because that
[03:16] <Unhelpful> DMKrow: yes, you have to modify the partition table. ;)
[03:16] <curio_> DMKrow, yes it does internally, you don't have to do it yourself
[03:16] <Unhelpful> sorry, *it* has to modify. not you ;)
[03:17] <curio_> Frd^, index on which entries ?
[03:17] <Frd^> oneline on chat is one id on sql
[03:17] <curio_> okay
[03:18] <curio_> it seems that it don't use SQL at all
[03:18] <curio_> except for selecting a date
[03:18] <DMKrow> thx, right now fdisk reads only p0 and p1, concerned that the table was damaged - can Odin safely restore the partition table?
[03:18] <Frd^> just thinkig if i setup virtual machine for that logging =) and host it from here
[03:18] <DMKrow> wait maybe that was p1 and p2
[03:19] <curio_> DMKrow, on most phones, /sbin/init which is in ramdisk automatically restores MBR at each boot
[03:19] <curio_> it reads the size of the disk, calculate the required sizes and write it
[03:19] <DMKrow> hmmm...afraid when I hit adb reboot, didn't sync - it came up missing sd card
[03:20] <curio_> there is an exception with t-mobile vibrant and another phone in south korea, where /sbin/init don't overwrite MBR at each boot
[03:20] <curio_> DMKrow, you're afrait to have damaged your partition table ?
[03:20] <curio_> how ?
[03:21] <DMKrow> adb reboot - it came up and could not find "sd card" - clockwork won't load, because recovery cant find mmcblkp...forget
[03:21] dobran (dobran@5634d43f.rev.stofanet.dk) left irc: 
[03:21] <curio_> on which kernel ?
[03:21] <DMKrow> I am currently doing a adb pull /mmcblk0p1
[03:21] <curio_> lol
[03:22] <Unhelpful> DMKrow: that's odd, because it shouldn't be changing the first entry in the partition table.
[03:22] <curio_> DMKrow, check your dmesg first
[03:22] <DMKrow> :) I did a clockwork recovery - stupid me I didn't copy to SD
[03:23] <curio_> if your're on voodoo CWM recovery currently don't start
[03:23] <curio_> only in RFS mode
[03:23] <Frd^> CWR isnät working on voodoo
[03:23] Action: Unhelpful thinks he might need to try getting rid of the voodoo-ext layout and using a straight voodoo layout.
[03:23] <DMKrow> no I did cwr before
[03:23] <curio_> voodoo-ext, don't know that :)
[03:23] <Unhelpful> curio_: what i call the overlapped p2/p4 case. had to name it *something*.
[03:23] <DMKrow> did the Just Another Dev beta1 + Voodoo - nice work otherwise
[03:24] <Unhelpful> blackmagic maybe? :P
[03:24] <curio_> haha Unhelpful
[03:24] <Frd^> i think i can get host were we can run that ilbot on mysql
[03:24] <curio_> Unhelpful, so the kernel accept overlapping partitions ?
[03:24] <curio_> Frd^, i can on my linux box
[03:24] <Frd^> that is at you home?
[03:24] <DMKrow> anyway - is there a safe Odin restore to fall back to?
[03:25] <Unhelpful> curio_: oh, yes, it definitely does, and if i do the conversion from recovery mode it works great. :)
[03:25] <Frd^> curio_: do you got enought bw and disk to run it
[03:25] <Unhelpful> for a quick hack perhaps i should see if just throwing a reboot after conversion fixes...
[03:25] <curio_> oh yeah plenty
[03:26] <Frd^> then you should setup that ilbot on there =)
[03:26] <Frd^> i would got host on 1G link with enough hdd for free =)
[03:26] <curio_> i guess the most easy solution is to run it without modification
[03:26] <curio_> and then run wget -R on it ^^
[03:26] <curio_> to get a static version
[03:26] <Frd^> =DD
[03:27] <Frd^> i can wrote static versions on those if you really want
[03:27] <Frd^> but those search functions needs mysql
[03:28] <curio_> i really don't like the idea of a cgi script runing without cache or anything and using SQL to store ... to store flat files
[03:28] <curio_> that's just a bad design
[03:28] <DMKrow> curio_, you said init restores MBR - is this part of the binary or a ramdisk script?
[03:28] <curio_> it's code in samsung's  /bin/init
[03:29] <curio_> DMKrow, what's your phone ?
[03:29] <DMKrow> vibrant
[03:29] <curio_> tmobile ?
[03:29] <DMKrow> yeah
[03:29] <curio_> you have a p3 partition ?
[03:29] <curio_> ok
[03:29] <DMKrow> nope
[03:30] <curio_> oh you should
[03:30] <DMKrow> bummer
[03:30] <curio_> i don't know which binary JAC put into his ramdisk
[03:30] <DMKrow> cat /proc/partitions says p1 p2 p4
[03:30] <curio_> should say p1 p2 p3 p4
[03:30] <curio_> t-mo binary or standard vibrant binary
[03:31] <DMKrow> binary meaning init?
[03:31] <curio_> yes, executable

[03:32] <DMKrow> do you have docs somewhere on partition assignments? p4=ext4 data p3=?
[03:33] <curio_> p1 = vfat sdcard partition you share with the computer
[03:33] <curio_> p2 = /data (fs: RFS)
[03:33] <curio_> p3 = t-mobile vibrant unique partition which contain sims.apk
[03:34] <curio_> p4 = voodoo-specific ext4 partition
[03:34] <Unhelpful> silly that they give it its own partition :P

[04:02] <Hoffa> I really want to root the Fascinate, man, just wish it was reversible
[04:02] <Unhelpful> Hoffa: all root really does is install a few files and set permissions on one of them.
[04:02] <rafyvitto> rooting gives you more features =]
[04:02] <Unhelpful> i don't really get why anybody is scared of this.
[04:02] <rafyvitto> yep
[04:03] <Hoffa> no, I know, I just didn't root the Incredible until I knew it was reversible

[04:09] <Venim> Hoffa: where's the root threads
[04:09] <Hoffa> XDA should have a questionnaire to assess tech savviness, and then give each user a score so their posts are "weighted" by their credibility

[04:09] <Hoffa> eating dinner...really good BBQ :)
[04:13] <Unhelpful> Tux^verdreifelt: it could, but there's no passwd etc auth in place on the system, and that would not really be appropriate for a phone anyway
[04:13] <Tux^verdreifelt> i dunno if the galaxy is actually to be called a "phone"
[04:13] <Unhelpful> so what you get instead is an su binary that does auth by communicating w/ a system app that maintains a whitelist
[04:13] <Tux^verdreifelt> isn't it more like a laptop with a phone chip?
[04:14] <Unhelpful> ok, a thing w/ a touchscreen and no keyboard. :P
[04:14] <Tux^verdreifelt> so what is "appropriate" for a phone?
[04:14] <Unhelpful> the point being that typing passwords of any reasonable strength is *at best* very annoying on it, and that whitelisting by app is maybe more reasonable.
[04:14] <Tux^verdreifelt> rooting is not "appropriate" for a phone either
[04:14] <Tux^verdreifelt> given that sometimes kernel messages appear to the user..
[04:15] <Unhelpful> Tux^verdreifelt: yes, it would probably be better to provide daemons as root that serve access to specific resources, but nobody is doing that. :/
[04:15] <Tux^verdreifelt> at least samsung doesn't go the apple trip
[04:15] <Tux^verdreifelt> they /allow/ to root it
[04:16] <Tux^verdreifelt> (yet) :)
[04:16] <Unhelpful> as things stand, there's a db that the superuser app maintains that keys by app and by called program, and can allow or deny for any given entry.
[04:17] <Unhelpful> if an entry isn't found when an app makes a request, you get a popup that lets you grant or deny the access, and has a checkbox to remember your decisions as a rule.
[04:17] <Unhelpful> it tells you which app is asking, and what it's asking to run... though of course for "typical" users that probably means nothing.
[04:18] <Tux^verdreifelt> haha, i am glad that the galaxy doesn't have an actual shell app :) (or i haven't found one yet)
[04:18] <Tux^verdreifelt> i love to play on the shell :p
[04:18] <Tux^verdreifelt> and no, i don't want to know about one ;)
[04:18] <Tux^verdreifelt> would lead to serious issues, i presume :p
[04:19] <Unhelpful> android terminal :P
[04:19] <Unhelpful> or plug it in to a pc and run adb shell. :P
[04:20] <Hoffa> can I do all this adb stuff using the ADB wireless app? just curious

[04:21] <Tux^verdreifelt> Hoffa: must be the mac. get a real computer, kiddie.

[04:22] <Tux^verdreifelt> oh come on, you can't be serious.
[04:22] <Venim> i am completely serious
[04:22] <Tux^verdreifelt> mac os x is a major flaw.
[04:22] <Tux^verdreifelt> basically.
[04:22] <Venim> what did i have to do to my ipad to make it functional
[04:22] <Unhelpful> Hoffa: hey, i thought nextstep was pretty cool too! ;)
[04:22] <Venim> nothing
[04:22] <Venim> what did i have to do to make my galaxy s function
[04:22] <Venim> al
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> more insecure than windows BTW
[04:23] <Venim> wait for people to fix the crap that samsung doesn't know how to do
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> so...
[04:23] <Venim> so what
[04:23] <Hoffa> Venim: exactly
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> Venim: you mix up hard- and software
[04:23] <Venim> i'm not getting viruses on windows or mac
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> typical for apple kiddies
[04:23] <Venim> not really
[04:23] <Unhelpful> Venim: my mother has one and has no problems with it. expectations vary between users. :P
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> not having basic knowledge
[04:23] <Venim> apple makes their devices
[04:23] <Tux^verdreifelt> "galaxy s" <-> "mac os"
[04:23] <Venim> and their hardware
[04:23] <Venim> i said ipad
[04:23] <Venim> not mac os
[04:24] <Tux^verdreifelt> you love how mac os works. you don't have any clue of the hardware
[04:24] <Tux^verdreifelt> apple does NOT make hardware only because they have an apple printed on it
[04:24] <Unhelpful> ok-then,-ios :P
[04:24] <Venim> i hate people who blatantly hate apple for no reason
[04:24] <Venim> whats your reason for hatting apple Tux^verdreifelt
[04:25] <Venim> i'd love to know
[04:25] <Tux^verdreifelt> i hate apple for reasons. top reason: they try to control what i am doing with the thing I paid money for.
[04:25] <Venim> o boo fuckign hoo
[04:25] <Unhelpful> Venim: you *did* ask. and he *has* a point.
[04:25] <Venim> they just like their devices to work
[04:25] <Tux^verdreifelt> i'd have to fucking crack my own phone
[04:25] <Tux^verdreifelt> to be able to USE it
[04:25] <Venim> and whats your point
[04:25] <Venim> to USE it?
[04:25] <Tux^verdreifelt> to USE it
[04:25] <Tux^verdreifelt> learn to read, indeed.
[04:26] <Venim> umm... ok
[04:26] <Venim> what cant' you USE on an iphone
[04:26] <Unhelpful> widgets. :)
[04:26] <Tux^verdreifelt> second reason: expensive dumbshit. lifestyle trash. not worth the thousand bucks compared to a galaxy s
[04:26] <Tux^verdreifelt> worse hardware, worse OS.
[04:26] <Venim> Unhelpful: widgets are a personal preference that apple decided nto to have
[04:26] <Venim> not a reason to hate them for it
[04:26] <Venim> i don't like widgets :p
[04:27] <Venim> how is it a worse os
[04:27] <Venim> i find it quite nice
[04:27] <Tux^verdreifelt> Venim: you got the point. apple decides "not to have" something, so if i buy something from them, they tell ME what to do with it
[04:27] <Unhelpful> Venim: they're part of controlling what users and developers can do on their platform. you asked how you can't "use" a iphone, i gave an example.
[04:27] <theAlchemist> i love widgets
[04:27] <theAlchemist> apples ui is dull
[04:27] <Venim> well what if android didn't code things for widgets
[04:27] <Tux^verdreifelt> see, you can't even watch p0rn with the iphone :p
[04:27] <Venim> yes you can
[04:27] <theAlchemist> hasnt changed since it came out
[04:27] <Venim> thats the biggest bullshit argument ever
[04:27] <theAlchemist> but android does
[04:27] <Venim> all of youporn and pornhub are html5
[04:27] <Venim> there you go
[04:28] <Venim> more porn than you'll ever need
[04:28] <Unhelpful> Tux^verdreifelt: there are only a hojillion sites that will cheerfully serve all the porn you can eat to your iphone.
[04:28] <Tux^verdreifelt> you don't know my porn preferences :p
[04:28] <Venim> also
[04:28] <Venim> i have flash on my ipad
[04:28] <Venim> whats the big deal
[04:28] <Unhelpful> and there already were when steve said "no porn on iphone"
[04:28] <Hoffa> guys, why the pissing match?
[04:28] Action: Unhelpful points and screams "HE STARTED IT!"
[04:28] <theAlchemist> lol
[04:28] <Venim> Hoffa: i just find it really annoying when people piss on apple for no reason
[04:28] <Venim> sry
[04:29] <Venim> they just LOVE linux so much
[04:29] <Tux^verdreifelt> Unhelpful: why does steve think it's HIS decision on what users WHO PAID FOR HIS CRAP are meant to do with it?
[04:29] <Venim> and probably haven't used a mac for more than 10 minutes
[04:29] <theAlchemist> Venim there will be reasons
[04:29] <Venim> theAlchemist: but the virility in their hate is just mind numbing to me
[04:29] <Venim> Tux^verdreifelt: every company decides what their users do
[04:29] <Venim> they have to make it
[04:29] <Venim> if they don't make it, it doesn't work
[04:29] <theAlchemist> true Venim
[04:30] <theAlchemist> i dont hate apple
[04:30] <Venim> if google didn't code widgets into android
[04:30] <Venim> they wouldn't exist
[04:30] <Venim> you couldn't use them
[04:30] <theAlchemist> just got bored with iphone
[04:30] <Venim> theAlchemist: and thats completely valid :p
[04:30] <Unhelpful> Venim: they decide what their hardware and software is capable of. that is different from telling you what you can and can't do on it.
[04:30] <Venim> i mean, i have an android phone
[04:30] <Hoffa> hardware and design-wise, the iPhone is gorgeous, but I prefer to use Android
[04:30] <Tux^verdreifelt> Venim: apple is the only company that doesn't let its users decide. they force them to use itunes, they force them to avoid flash websited, ...
[04:30] <Venim> and they control the user experience to an extent
[04:30] <Unhelpful> you could code an alternate homescreen for android if there was no built-in widgets support. apple won't allow replacements for the homescreen.
[04:31] <Tux^verdreifelt> anyway, it's pointless to argue about apple with an apple fanboy, i see
[04:31] <Unhelpful> Tux^verdreifelt: um, MS, Zune?
[04:31] <Venim> i'm not an apple fanboy am i
[04:31] <Venim> i have android
[04:31] <theAlchemist> no point in hating apple, vote against them by not purchasing their products
[04:31] <Venim> i have a desktop with linux
[04:31] <Tux^verdreifelt> Unhelpful: zune is dead, there is a good reason for that
[04:31] <Venim> i just don't fucking loathe apple for no reason
[04:31] <Venim> their stuff is good
[04:31] <Venim> if you don't like it, just don't like it
[04:31] <Venim> don't go and demonize someone for running a company in a slightly different way
[04:31] <Tux^verdreifelt> their stuff is "good" but trying to control its buyers, so, basically, it is defective by design
[04:32] <Venim> and you know what
[04:32] <Venim> people get around that
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> you have to crack an iphone to be able to administrate it
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> so GTFO
[04:32] <Venim> and you ahve to root an android device
[04:32] <Unhelpful> oh ffs. :P
[04:32] <Venim> they don't come rooted do they?
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> no, you don't :
[04:32] <Hoffa> exactly, Venim
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> mine is not rooted wither
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> either
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> but it has no simlock :)
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> or whateber
[04:32] <theAlchemist> Venim:
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> evrrt
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> everr
[04:32] <Tux^verdreifelt> ffs
[04:32] <theAlchemist> You dont have to root
[04:32] Action: Tux^verdreifelt slaps Tux^verdreifelt around a bit with a large trout
[04:33] <Venim> there's quite a few customizations you do have to root with
[04:33] <Venim> unless you are compeltely reliant on someone else

[04:33] <Tux^verdreifelt> Venim: most things the iphone has to be cracked for work fine on an unrooted android phone.
[04:33] <theAlchemist> in fact i only have 1 customisation that needs root
[04:33] <Venim> whats your point
[04:33] <Venim> jailbreaking the iphone isn't a big deal
[04:33] <Tux^verdreifelt> like, allowing third-party apps
[04:34] <Venim> lawl
[04:34] <Venim> i have att
[04:34] <Venim> i couldn't do that anyway
[04:34] <theAlchemist> now Venim thats not true
[04:34] <Tux^verdreifelt> "jailbreaking the iphone", damn, you SEE what's wrong with apple?

[04:34] <theAlchemist> always waiting for the next jailbreak, which apple blocks so another jb is needed and on and on it goes
[04:34] <Venim> its not wrong for apple to want to control their experience
[04:34] <O_oo> lol
[04:34] <Tux^verdreifelt> * Added *!*DanCohen@server3.mathcs.duq.edu to ignore list
[04:34] <Venim> have you seen how shitty people iphones look
[04:34] <Tux^verdreifelt> enough fanboy chitchat for today
[04:34] <theAlchemist> yes it is Venim
[04:34] <Venim> how the fuck can you think i'm a fanboy when i'm sitting here in a galaxy s forum
[04:34] <Venim> chat*
[04:35] <theAlchemist> once you purchase it you own it
[04:35] <theAlchemist> do you own an SGS Venim?
[04:35] <Venim> yes
[04:35] <Venim> never owned an iphone or ipod touch even
[04:35] <theAlchemist> so is it rooted?
[04:35] <Venim> ofc
[04:35] <Venim> first thing i did
[04:35] <Venim> took it out of the box and rooted it
[04:35] <theAlchemist> but you shouldnt as samsung didnt design it for that
[04:36] <Venim> whats the problem
[04:36] <theAlchemist> to use your argument
[04:36] <Venim> no
[04:36] <Venim> i never said you shouldn't be allowed to ignore what a company says if the tools are there
[04:36] <Venim> i said the company decided not to let you do that
[04:36] <Venim> and thats their prerogative
[04:37] <theAlchemist> samsung by their perogative will lose alot of customers
[04:37] <Venim> they deserve it
[04:37] <Unhelpful> and some users object to that. that's their prerogative. :P
[04:37] <Venim> their phone runs like crap when stock
[04:37] <Venim> luckily we have smart people who are unhappy with that
[04:37] <Unhelpful> again, my mom has no trouble w/ her stock i897. :)
[04:38] <Venim> great for her !
[04:38] <Venim> it doesn't run nearly as good as an iphone
[04:38] <theAlchemist> well yes thats because iphone is not a true multi tasking device
[04:38] <Unhelpful> you mean a 4? because my wife's 3gs is not as nice as a stock captivate imo.
[04:39] <Venim> well its running ios4 isn't
[04:39] <Venim> it
[04:39] <theAlchemist> i agree Unhelpful and thats why i moved from 3gs
[04:39] <Venim> theAlchemist: ios4 multi tasks just as well as android
[04:39] <Venim> if the developers code for it
[04:40] <theAlchemist> no it suspends the app
[04:40] <Venim> so
[04:40] <theAlchemist> that is known
[04:40] <Venim> my app is great for that
[04:40] <theAlchemist> hmm maybe
[04:40] <Venim> it suspends
[04:40] <Venim> and then picks up perfectly like it never got closed
[04:40] <Venim> doesn't take up any resources
[04:40] <Venim> perfection
[04:40] <theAlchemist> but its not multitasking
[04:40] <Venim> so
[04:40] <theAlchemist> lol
[04:40] <Venim> it lets multiple tasks run
[04:40] <theAlchemist> you said it did
[04:40] <Venim> if the developer codes it
[04:40] <Venim> an app can stay connected to data for 10 minutes
[04:40] <theAlchemist> and the if apple approves it
[04:41] <theAlchemist> and so on
[04:41] <Venim> well you know what
[04:41] <Venim> i'm a big fan of the app store policy
[04:41] <Venim> because you don't get really crappy apps
[04:41] <theAlchemist> good for you
[04:41] <Venim> they approve pretty much everything

[04:42] <Unhelpful> oh, there are definitely crap shovelware apps for it :P
[04:42] <Venim> or don't do what they say
[04:42] <Unhelpful> Venim: or things that try to do anything the included apps do differently/better.
[04:42] <theAlchemist> and they reject great apps that managed memory too
[04:42] <Venim> you shouldn't /need/ to manage memory
[04:42] <Venim> thats their point

[11:21] <jreddekopp> I just don't understand how the stock galaxy s phones ever got past QC testing with that stupid filesystem
[11:21] <BjH> jreddekopp: Politics.

[11:23] <BjH> jreddekopp: Samsung invented RFS, so they can't just ditch that.
[11:24] <jreddekopp> I suppose that's true, but you'd think they could at least improve it
[11:24] <jreddekopp> they made all these phones with great hardware and then they crippled them
[11:25] <jreddekopp> it's sad, really
[11:25] <BjH> How so? RFS is based upon FAT16/FAT32, and they can't change that part without losing compatibility.
[11:28] <CampGareth> ext4 would I'm guessing be cheaper to use in the first place since it doesn't take as much work to integrate an existing awesome filesystem than to make your own and make sure it works nicely
[11:28] <CampGareth> then again, people make stupid decisions every day, it's not surprising that every once in a while a company makes one too

[11:29] <BjH> CampGareth: RFS isn't that new an invention. They have it, they have to use it.
[11:30] <CampGareth> but... but that's like saying you've got a nail in your foot, you have to keep it now since you made holes in all your footwear to accomodate it
[11:30] <theAlchemist> i saw an add on tv before for the sgs and i had to think of what people were getting themselves into
[11:32] <BjH> CampGareth: Depends. Dunno if Samsung is selling RFS to others, but if they are it would be *really* stupid of them to *not* use it.
[11:34] <CampGareth> *sigh* selling nails in the foot to others... well ****ing done samsung for trying to make money and in doing so harming anyone who buys just about anything from you
[11:34] <CampGareth> kinda wishing I'd waited for the HTC Desire HD now but there's something appealing about a community-run underdog

[11:44] <theAlchemist> and yet i have a tv and sound system of theirs and they work fine
[11:46] <CampGareth> Ah, fair enough, then yes a common enemy although my experience is a tad more bitter as the only other samsung made device (minus components of course) I have is a 10GB HDD

[11:47] <BjH> I used to have another Samsung mobile, but went back to Nokia after that.
[11:47] <BjH> And the SGS ... well, I like it. Yeah, the fs sucks, but as long as that stays the only real drawback ...
[11:50] <CampGareth> GPS might be used, radio... only in extreme circumstances
[11:52] <BjH> Never saw any GPS issues, but I only used it for navigation.
[11:52] <CampGareth> oh and what about the limited RAM through having some weird ramdisk that's bigger than it needs to be nomming on it? Multitasking becomes an issue...

[12:07] <GrimmVarg> voodoo
[12:14] <GrimmVarg> btw
[12:14] <GrimmVarg> i can go from beta4 to just installing the lagfix right?
[12:14] <GrimmVarg> without needing to uninstall first
[12:16] <CampGareth> well, it'd work yes but you wouldn't remove the colour changes
[12:17] <GrimmVarg> ah..
[12:17] <GrimmVarg> so uninstall and then reinstall then
[12:17] <CampGareth> at least not if I remember correctly, which I probably dont, go find a smart person
[12:17] knowsnotmuch (~ashwind@122.174.133.182) joined #project-voodoo.
[12:17] <BjH> Any official word on a release date for Froyo yet?
[12:18] <GrimmVarg> CampGareth: haha.. ill try to just update first.. afaik, this _should_ replace the kernel, which is where tha lagfix is
[12:18] <CampGareth> you're probably right, ammending memory.
[12:19] <CampGareth> why did I have it in my head that voodoo modifies the existing stuff rather than replacing it I wonder
[12:19] <GrimmVarg> well, its hard to keep ones head straight aroudn all this stuff
[12:20] <GrimmVarg> but do you know is the soundfix is in the lagfixonlye version? or is it _just_ the lagfix with stock kernel?
[12:20] <GrimmVarg> wth
[12:20] <GrimmVarg> my phone went into downloadmode
[12:20] <CampGareth> I'd imagine just the lagfix, haven't heard anything of a soundfix
[12:20] <GrimmVarg> ok
[12:21] <CampGareth> thought that was something else entirely, fixed by dialing an unusual number and then pushing more buttons
[12:21] <GrimmVarg> the soundfix?
[12:21] <GrimmVarg> are you talking about gpsfix?
[12:22] <GrimmVarg> cuz the soundfix was that the soundlevel wasnt remembered by the system after sleep
[12:22] <GrimmVarg> afaik, curio fixed this in beta2,
[12:22] <CampGareth> Ah right, sorry, had no idea...
[12:22] <GrimmVarg> but its not really mentioned on the webpage
[12:23] <CampGareth> I only remember the applied EQ whenever headphones are plugged in (yet no EQ when hooked up to an amplifier)
[12:23] <GrimmVarg> ah
[12:25] <CampGareth> oh and that's mentioned!
[12:25] <CampGareth> "Does this Kernel require disabling a headphone equalizer with Service Mode?
[12:25] <CampGareth> No need to, the headphone output dont suffer from the bad EQ applied in first versions of Galaxy S firmwares."
[12:41] <CampGareth> now if only my SGS would arrive, apparently it's being held back for a firmware update so I fear JPH might have reached me prematurely
[12:41] <CampGareth> or some such, make sense out of that

[15:33] <distortedloop> is it just stuck on the S, can you adb at that point?

[15:36] <distortedloop> ok, so, if it were me, first thing I would do is run adb logcat and see if I can figure out where it's stuck at, night be something easily fixed

[15:46] <ragflan> yeah true. that's stock android.. i like that to galaxy s glass lock
[15:46] <ragflan> the one method on xda is complicated... the other one was for jm8

[15:48] <Sturmeh> can i delete the logs voodoo makes?
[15:49] <kalpik> you guys saw this? http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=786509
[15:50] <Sturmeh> *see
[15:50] <kalpik> interchangeable?
[15:50] <Sturmeh> why bother?
[15:51] <kalpik> bother with what? :P
[15:51] <Sturmeh> the stock kernel voodoo?

[15:51] <kalpik> cause stock is better than compiled kernel
[15:51] <kalpik> samsung's sources are stale
[15:51] <Sturmeh> mm
[15:52] <kalpik> stock kernels are much more optimised.. i've even seen curio admit to that :P
[15:52] <Sturmeh> sounds interesting
[15:52] <Sturmeh> curio should take a look at it
[15:52] <Sturmeh> :)
[15:52] <kalpik> he knows about it :)
[15:53] <Sturmeh> good
[15:53] <kalpik> they were working on a way to do this in an automated way
[15:53] <ragflan> kalpik: optimised how? im just asking. i really dunno...
[15:54] <kalpik> but the conclusion (then) was that this was too much effort, and it cannot be automated.. requires some (meticulous?) calculations etc etc..
[15:54] <kalpik> ragflan: better battery life, some bugs fixed (wifi et. all)
[15:54] <Chainfire> arrr
[15:54] Action: Chainfire is back
[15:54] <kalpik> :)
[15:54] <Chainfire> time to patch that JPH kernel
[15:54] <ragflan> :D
[15:54] <kalpik> AND we can do that ^^
[15:55] <kalpik> ragflan: samsung's sources are from the time of JFx series
[15:55] <Chainfire> still haven't figured how to increase size for initramfs though... so gotta remove some junk
[15:55] <Sturmeh> like what
[15:56] <distortedloop> is ryan a fan of ext4 now, he's asking in that thread for an ext4 version.  I'm so confused by that guy sometimes
[15:56] <kalpik> lol
[15:56] <katsuru> lol
[15:57] <husq510> chainfire wondering too
[15:57] <Chainfire> eh?
[15:58] <Chainfire> you also working on fixing that kernel up ?
[15:58] <husq510> increase initramfs size
[15:58] <husq510> that we could use stock kernel
[15:58] <Chainfire> well i can increase the size in the file... but no idea if that would actually _work_
[15:58] <Chainfire> I think it wont, actually
[15:58] <Chainfire> internal pointers would need to be adjusted, but no idea where or how
[15:58] <Chainfire> IDA Pro wisely does not decompile kernels ;)
[15:58] <husq510> do you know where that ksyms?
[15:59] <husq510> __initramfs_start
[15:59] <Chainfire> nope
[15:59] <Chainfire> yeah but where is that in the binary
[16:00] <Chainfire> tried finding the offsets but so far no dice
[16:00] <husq510> i founf interesting article about mkbootimage
[16:00] <Chainfire> but i got some work to do for my toolset, so i'll start with just replacing whats in there now
[16:00] <Chainfire> see how far that'll get me
[16:00] <Chainfire> which will require me to build a few tools first :/
[16:00] <husq510> do you know kernel base for galaxy ?
[16:01] <Chainfire> how do you mean
[16:01] <husq510> did you look at mkbootimage
[16:01] <husq510> ?
[16:01] <Chainfire> nope
[16:01] <Chainfire> thus far I don't need to
[16:01] <husq510> how do you increase that else?
[16:02] <Chainfire> i dont know, but as I said, thats for later... first build an easy toolset to modify stuff _without_ increasing size
[16:02] <husq510> k
[16:02] <Chainfire> thats step 1... step 2 is changing the size :)
[16:02] <ragflan> sorry guys. another random question. ROM Manager still doesn't work right? what's the best way to do a nandroid backup?

[17:03] <katsuru> doesnt get past " wait until i determine if your hosts are up to date "
[17:03] <katsuru> :S
[17:03] <Liliniser> kalpik: yes of course lol
[17:03] <kalpik> Liliniser: great! looking forward to a JPH lagfix :D
[17:04] <Liliniser> kalpik: but the thing is the lack of modules
[17:04] <kalpik> Liliniser: also, are you going to fix the root bug soon? I'm waiting for that to update here :D
[17:04] <wArri> Venim I am flashing congnition atm (first disabling lagfix) will let you know how it goes
[17:04] <katsuru> can ayn1 check if their adfree is working ?

[17:08] <katsuru> wth
[17:08] <katsuru> mine doesnt
[17:08] <katsuru> i believe it has something to do with my titanium backup?
[17:08] <katsuru> since i installed new firmware
[17:08] <katsuru> and restores system + apps
[17:08] <katsuru> restored
[17:08] <kalpik> katsuru: i do the same everytime and it works!
[17:09] <katsuru> wth
[17:09] <katsuru> lol
[17:11] <Venim> wArri: already flashed
[17:11] <wArri> how is it?
[17:11] <Venim> nothing i don't already have
[17:11] <Venim> its nothing
[17:11] <wArri> yea thats what i thought

[17:11] <wArri> lol
[17:11] <Venim> whats the point of it?
[17:12] <katsuru> btw some1 on xda reported JPH to be compatible with mouse keyboard with not tricks
[17:12] <katsuru> any1 tried a wiimote on it already?
[17:12] <Venim> oya
[17:12] <Venim> it has bluez
[17:12] <wArri> it removes the compression of many of the files for easier theming/modification...
[17:12] <Venim> i forgot about that
[17:12] <Venim> wArri: cognition has bluez
[17:12] <Venim> apparently
[17:12] <wArri> bluez?

[17:12] <wArri> lol
[17:13] <Venim> default android bluetooth stack
[17:13] <wArri> ohh
[17:13] <Venim> so maybe wiimote support :/
[17:13] <wArri> i dont use bluetooth
[17:13] <wArri> but
[17:13] <wArri> that would be cool
[17:13] <Venim> i flashed it
[17:13] <wArri> yea im doing it now
[17:13] <Venim> decided i was too lazy to restore all my apps with titanium
[17:13] <Venim> and revereted
[17:13] <wArri> lol
[17:13] <wArri> if you have premium tibu it does it without promts
[17:14] <Venim> ya
[17:14] <Venim> i don't
[17:14] <Venim> and i don't flash enough to pay for it yet
[17:14] <wArri> i disabled-lagfix, making nandroid, clearing data and cash, and installing cognition
[17:14] <katsuru> any1 got JPH and a wiimote?
[17:14] <wArri> its what #1.99

[17:24] <Chainfire> Liliniser> well im writing the tools for the job at the moment... when those are finished, i can run the first test... and then ill know if it works :D
[17:25] <Chainfire> modify JPH kernel to include su, Superuser.apk, and load test keys at recovery
[17:25] <Chainfire> (but release keys during normal boot)
[17:25] <Liliniser> Chainfire: sounds cooool
[17:26] <kalpik> Chainfire: i was thinking of flashing to JM8.. But if you're close, ill hang on a bit :P
[17:26] <Chainfire> why flash to jm8 ?
[17:26] <kalpik> for Liliniser's fix
[17:26] <Liliniser> hehe
[17:26] <kalpik> and i was also thinking of trying out doc
[17:26] <kalpik> doc's rom
[17:27] <Chainfire> which fix, specifically?

[17:28] <kalpik> Chainfire: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=786509
[17:28] <Chainfire> ahhh I guess you need modules compiled to 2.2 for that ?
[17:29] <Chainfire> (which ones?)
[17:29] <Frd^> any1 have good howto modify framwork-res.apk?

[17:33] <BackfireNL> jep me
[17:33] <BackfireNL> kalpik? what?
[17:33] <BackfireNL> what fix
[17:33] <BackfireNL> new root?
[17:33] <Chainfire> you can do me a great help by creating an update.zip for me (for froyo) that does... nothing!
[17:33] <kalpik> BackfireNL: voodoo on stock kernel
[17:33] <Chainfire> just to check if the cert verify fix works
[17:33] <BackfireNL> haha uhm yeah use my update.zip for rooting chainfire ;)
[17:33] <Chainfire> just set progressbar to finished and do nothing useful
[17:34] <Chainfire> BackfireNL you have an update.zip for rooting JPH ?
[17:34] <BackfireNL> jep
[17:34] <kalpik> Chainfire: use the same onw
[17:34] <kalpik> as 2.1
[17:34] <kalpik> should work
[17:34] <BackfireNL> Chainfire i'll get you the link ;)
[17:34] <Chainfire> k cool
[17:34] <BackfireNL> voodoo on stock kernel? you got to be kidding
[17:34] <BackfireNL> does it work on JPH?
[17:35] <Frd^> any1 have good howto modify framwork-res.apk? and how to make those update.zip's?
[17:35] <Chainfire> BackfireNL> how did you get around the cert verify on JPH with update.zip ?

[17:35] <BackfireNL> but there are other ways
[17:35] <Frd^> Play Voodoo with STOCK ECLAIR kernels! - EXT4 / NILFS2 <<just wiped all /data from mine phone =))
[17:35] <Frd^> i like
[17:35] <BackfireNL> like using recovery 2e
[17:35] <Chainfire> ah like that
[17:35] <Liliniser> Frd^: really????????
[17:36] <Chainfire> ehm that was the first JPH root listed on XDA
[17:36] <kalpik> Frd^: you're using NILFS or ext4?
[17:36] <Chainfire> switching kernels for root then switch back... as I recall I posted it :P
[17:36] <BackfireNL> jeps :)
[17:36] <BackfireNL> did not try any other way...
[17:36] <Chainfire> working on a modified kernel that doesn't need that... just flash the kernel through odin, done.
[17:36] <BackfireNL> but i was looking into the self signed update.zip's
[17:37] <Chainfire> still could you make me a really empty update.zip ? this thing that roots does things that would interfere with my testing

[17:43] <Frd^> converion when ok
[17:43] <Liliniser> mmm yes
[17:43] <Frd^> then i rebooted to recovery to imple voodoo with NILFS
[17:43] <Frd^> it when ok
[17:43] <Frd^> then it rebooted

[17:44] <BackfireNL> but uhhh
[17:44] <BackfireNL> people
[17:44] <BackfireNL> voodoo fix with stock kernels
[17:44] <BackfireNL> does this mean we can use it with JPH with the same method?
[17:44] <kalpik> soon
[17:44] <kalpik> :P
[17:44] <BackfireNL> @Chainfire making a empty update.zip now!
[17:44] <Liliniser> BackfireNL: all we need is that bloody modules!

[17:45] <kalpik> JM8 Tayutama vs DocRambone mod! Which one should I install?
[17:45] <Frd^> hmm should i flash to stock kernel and try that again =)
[17:45] <Liliniser> Frd^: oh if you didn't remove that "disable lagfix" folder
[17:46] <Liliniser> Frd^: before flashing mine
[17:46] ikm (~chatzilla@95-25-247-51.broadband.corbina.ru) joined #project-voodoo.
[17:46] <Frd^> Liliniser: i can remove that because voodoo starts convertion data before entering recovery mode
[17:46] <Frd^> *cant
[17:47] <Liliniser> there shouldn't be that disable lagfix folder when you are about to install update.zip
[17:47] <darksbane> Frd^: flash the new kernel, then adb shell into the phone from recovery and remove the fule
[17:47] <Frd^> so it need to be remove voodoo  -> flash stock kernel ->remove /sdcard/voodoo/disable lagfix, reboot recovery ->  update.zip reboot
[17:48] <kalpik> Frd^: flash stock in between?
[17:48] <Frd^> kalpik: i didn't
[17:48] <Liliniser> i don't think so..
[17:48] <BackfireNL> @Chainfire uploading the empty update.zip
[17:48] <Liliniser> don't need to flash stock kernel
[17:48] <kalpik> ok.. new release!
[17:48] <Frd^> Liliniser: how you remove disable lagfix folder then?

[17:49] <BackfireNL> @Chainfire http://www.multiupload.com/N3KI25JE74 empty update.zip

[17:50] <Frd^> i had voodoo b4 installed with ext4
[17:50] <BackfireNL> So i finished my automated method for rooting eclair today :)
[17:50] <Liliniser> yes
[17:50] <Frd^> so i pushed your update.zip to /sdcard/
[17:50] <Liliniser> yes
[17:51] <Frd^> then i made forlder /sdcard/voodoo/disable lagfix
[17:51] <Frd^> rebooted
[17:51] <Liliniser> yes
[17:51] <Frd^> and voodoo converted ext4 to rfs
[17:51] <Liliniser> yes
[17:51] <Liliniser> then it should be able to boot
[17:51] <Frd^> then rebooted
[17:51] <Frd^> i booted it up
[17:51] <wArri> Frd^ remeber its
[17:52] <wArri> disable-lagfix
[17:52] <wArri> with the dash
[17:52] <Frd^> wArri: there is no ecaxt right
[17:52] <Chainfire> thx BackfireNL
[17:52] <wArri> what?
[17:52] <Liliniser> Frd^: yes after that
[17:52] <Frd^> disable lagfix/disable.lagfix etc works
[17:53] <Liliniser> Frd^: at this time, you could remove that disable lagfix folder
[17:53] <wArri> oh i idnt know it wasnt exact
[17:53] <Frd^> it's find / -name disable lagfix
[17:53] <Frd^> it match many
[17:53] <wArri> gotcha
[17:53] <Frd^> so i removed that disable lagfix folder and shutdown mine phobe. hit 3 button compo
[17:53] <Liliniser> yes
[17:53] <Frd^> tried to go recovery
[17:54] <Liliniser> ah
[17:54] <Frd^> but voodoo started to convert data to ext4 before i got i recovery =)
[17:54] <Liliniser> ok
[17:54] <Liliniser> ok i got it
[17:54] <Frd^> and after conversion was done
[17:54] <Frd^> it booted to recovery
[17:54] <Liliniser> hahaha okok
[17:54] <Liliniser> yeah you're right
[17:55] <Liliniser> flashing stock kernel is needed
[17:55] <kalpik> that's what i said :P
[17:56] <darksbane> kalpik: is there some reason you can't flash the update.zip, and then remove the disable lagfix file?
[17:56] <BackfireNL> @Chainfire Are you removing the signed update.zip check from the kernel?
[17:56] <Frd^> or needs to modify that your script if partition is rfs and /sdcard/voodoo/disable lagfix exist it just boots up =)
[17:56] <kalpik> darksbane: im not getting what you're trying to say :s
[17:57] <darksbane> kalpik: hrm. was there something complicated about what i said? :P
[17:57] <kalpik> flash what update.zip?
[17:57] <Liliniser> Frd^: thanks I'll work on it
[17:57] <darksbane> Frd^:  "Frd^: so i pushed your update.zip to /sdcard/"
[17:58] <darksbane> err sorry, wrong target
[17:58] <Frd^> darksbane: =)
[17:58] <kalpik> darksbane: to flash the update.zip you need to boot to recovery.. and voodoo runs before recovery is up..
[17:58] <Frd^> yeah
[17:59] <darksbane> sure, that's why i ask, why aren't you flashing the update.zip before you delete the disable lagfix file?
[17:59] <darksbane> then voodoo won't convert to ext4...
[17:59] <kalpik> darksbane: apparently Liliniser's kernel does not boot if it finds disable lagfix folder :s
[17:59] <darksbane> so adb shell in while in recovery, before rebooting
[18:00] <Liliniser> kalpik: it does..
[18:00] <Frd^> it wipes /data
[18:00] <kalpik> oh
[18:00] <kalpik> btw, not ONE person has replied on my question :P
[18:00] <darksbane> in anycase, sure flash stock im sure that'd work. just seems like there was something missing here. heh.
[18:00] <Liliniser> if it finds disable fagfix folder, it tries to convert to ext4 and in the end it tries to convert back
[18:01] <distortedloop> Isn't that one of the safety checks in curio_'s model?
[18:01] <Liliniser> at the first time
[18:02] <Frd^> afk now
[18:03] <Frd^> any1 have good howto modify framwork-res.apk? and how to make those update.zip's? =) hilight nick if you got or pm =)

[18:12] milvus (~milvus@121-249.105-92.cust.bluewin.ch) joined #project-voodoo.
[18:12] <dfjzefjujjkj> anyone know if the "disable lagfix" folder procedure unsintalls the lagfix completely ?
[18:12] <dfjzefjujjkj> or do I have to "update.zip" with the kernel backed up in the sd ?
[18:12] <dfjzefjujjkj> because even with fix disabled theres still written curio kernel in the phone details ^^
[18:13] <cocoto> Yes, you have to flash
[18:13] <cocoto> (desactivate before)
[18:13] <wArri> if my phone is stuck in a boot loop, but voodoo fix is enabled, can i still oneclick, then install voodoo and disable it?
[18:13] <dfjzefjujjkj> Well basically my issue is the battery drain I'm running on JM2 firmware but the battery dies so fast (70-80 %) used within 6 hours or idle by the display only
[18:14] <cocoto> @wArri : I don't understand exactly your preoblem...
[18:15] <wArri> im currently stuck in a boot loop
[18:15] <wArri> and i cant get back to flash anything
[18:15] <wArri> so im going to one click
[18:15] <wArri> but the ext4 partion is still on my phone no?
[18:15] <cocoto> @dfjzefjujjkj : If you want to completely remove the lagfix, you just have to disable, and reflash a new JM2...
[18:16] <wArri> in other words, i never disabled the lagfix before flashing odin 1 click
[18:17] <cocoto> @wArri : there is a procedure... I search ^^
[18:17] <cocoto> Look at http://project-voodoo.org/documentation just before "known issues" ;)
[18:18] <dfjzefjujjkj> alright
[18:18] <dfjzefjujjkj> thanks

[18:19] <dfjzefjujjkj> okay
[18:19] <dfjzefjujjkj> can i root
[18:19] <dfjzefjujjkj> over the vodoo fix ?
[18:19] <dfjzefjujjkj> it is disabled at the moment
[18:19] <dfjzefjujjkj> but not uninstalled
[18:19] <cocoto> Yes, it's completely independant...
[18:20] <dfjzefjujjkj> okay thanks
[18:20] <dfjzefjujjkj> do you know if it's possible to unroot a phone too ?
[18:21] <cocoto> If you apply the "one click" method, yes. But if you use the "update.zip" method, I don't think...
[18:21] <cocoto> (sry for my english)
[18:21] <BackfireNL> @ dfjzefjujjkj yes you can! http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=728754 read this

[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> voodoo is very nice
[18:22] <cocoto> BackfireNl <3
[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> but im just trying to figure out if its the culprit of my battery drain ^^
[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> since
[18:22] <BackfireNL> http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=728754 this is also similar to the onclick method but easier if you use the automated method
[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> i bought the sgs two days ago
[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> three minutes later I already had the voodoo on it
[18:22] <dfjzefjujjkj> ahah
[18:23] <dfjzefjujjkj> Yea no problem I think ill use the 2.1 2.2 unroot app one click in xda thanks again for the link
[18:23] <dfjzefjujjkj> just hope my drivers won't fuck up and ruin my current firmware ahah
[18:24] <BackfireNL> unroot app?
[18:24] <BackfireNL> do you mean the one from my tutorial
[18:24] <BackfireNL> or one click root?
[18:25] <BackfireNL> my method does not require net framework to be installed on your PC because it's dos based
[18:25] <dfjzefjujjkj> yea this one ! http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/how-to-root-and-unroot-samsung-galaxy-s-i9000-with-a-single-click/
[18:25] <BackfireNL> ok
[18:25] <BackfireNL> well whatever you wan't :P
[18:26] <dfjzefjujjkj> dunno ^^ I'll prolly end up rooting with the zip method lol
[18:26] <BackfireNL> uhm :P i wrote a automated update method
[18:26] <BackfireNL> easier than one click root
[18:27] <cocoto> Y always apply this method... I don't trust in Windows....

[19:28] <jusama14> oh ok
[19:29] <curio_> hey Frd^ :) how are you
[19:30] <Frd^> fine
[19:30] <Frd^> curio_: https://shell.frdnet.net/project-voodoo/project-voodoo.log.2010-09-19.html
[19:31] <Frd^> could those log look somethink like that?
[19:31] <raspdeep> watsup with secure stuff
[19:32] <curio_> Frd^, you choosed to develop from scratch ?
[19:32] <Frd^> curio_: yes =)
[19:33] <Frd^> because you wanted those flatfiles
[19:33] <curio_> yeah it's alright
[19:33] <curio_> good ol'tables
[19:33] <curio_> ^^
[19:33] <Frd^> those could be converted from flat.txt from cron throuth small perl script =)
[19:33] <Frd^> curio_: easyes way =)
[19:34] <Frd^> i could make it to divs but no point on this matter
[19:34] <curio_> Frd^, tables are perfectly valid to present this type of infos :)
[19:34] <Frd^> only if we wanted to make php search including ajax =)
[19:34] <curio_> your algorythm to choose nicknames colors looks pretty good !
[19:35] <curio_> Frd^, i must admit i really liked the "filter by nickname" present in the solution seen yesterday
[19:35] <curio_> Frd^, i guess it's quite easy to do with a bit of jquery magic
[19:35] <Frd^> curio_: i did that by hand =D
[19:36] <curio_> you know, attribute a class to the each tr for every nickname
[19:36] <curio_> and switch display="none" or not
[19:36] <Frd^> yeah
[19:36] <Frd^> that could be easy
[19:36] <curio_> :)
[19:37] <Frd^> i try to make that front bage first
[19:37] <Frd^> i did that layout lastnight abount 4:00 =)
[19:37] <curio_> yeah it's more useful (and more challenging too!)
[19:37] <Frd^> or was it later
[19:37] <curio_> even if you were sleepy you did well ^^
[19:38] <Frd^> 04:39:34 < Frd^> dman you.. << i just got it
[19:38] <Frd^> i you left =)
[19:38] <curio_> haha
[19:39] <curio_> it's php code ,
[19:39] <damel> hehe
[19:39] <curio_> ?
[19:39] <Frd^> i went to sleep at 9:00
[19:39] <Frd^> "i you left =)" = and you left =)"
[19:39] Action: Frd^ too much multitasking..
[19:40] <Frd^> curio_: what php?
[19:40] <Frd^> that all is flat files
[19:40] <Frd^> i make small perl script what makes those
[19:40] <Frd^> and after that i imple that "filter by nick"-thing
[19:40] <curio_> ah perl
[19:41] <curio_> oh filter by nick is better done on client side
[19:41] <curio_> with javascript = more interactivity
[19:41] <curio_> and less server load, if any ^^
[19:41] <wArri> curio_ i dont know if you saw but .. this was posted yesterday about clockwork mod for Captivate http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=8209311&postcount=264
[19:42] <curio_> okay
[19:42] <Frd^> curio_: yeah i do that with javascript later
[19:42] <wArri> so maybe koush finished and didnt want to tell us!!
[19:42] <curio_> we will see if he just activated the 50% working CWM on ext4 or new code by Koush

[19:51] <curio_> isn't this version "number" (or letter) strange ?

[19:53] <BackfireNL> any updates?
[19:53] <Tund> no experiences here of JI1? I guess it's a little early
[19:54] <BackfireNL> still running JPH ;)

[20:14] <Unhelpful> but probably a lot of it will work. however i suspect it means you'll always have console there instead of bootscreen.
[20:14] <Unhelpful> what we really want is probably more like this: http://code.google.com/p/fbterm/
[20:14] <Unhelpful> run fbterm during setup? :)
[20:15] <curio_> at worst it will require some changes in the frame buffer driver (to remove the static boot image)
[20:15] <Unhelpful> yes, but i'm not really sure full console is desirable
[20:15] <curio_> for debugging, it is :)
[20:15] <Unhelpful> what we really want is a way to temporarily display text for script feedback.
[20:15] <Unhelpful> well, yes, for debugging.
[20:16] <curio_> to show that you're super geek too :p
[20:16] <curio_> well, i should have said "we"
[20:17] <curio_> of course it will slow down boot a bit
[20:17] <Unhelpful> hah, yeah, tux logo + text == geeky.
[20:17] <curio_> :))
[20:17] <Unhelpful> depends, but yeah, framebuffer text scrolling can really hurt performance.

[20:49] <op3c2d2r> so any word on Samsung's GPS fix?  or at least 2.2 update?
[20:50] <oskariunit> gps works fine with jm8
[20:50] <oskariunit> atleast 200m more accurate than jm2 :p
[20:51] <robo> op3c2d2r rumor 23/24 sep its near!
[20:51] <robo> op3c2d2r i mean froyo...
[20:52] <op3c2d2r> oskariunit, really?  so issues like the accuracy errors in this thread are gone with jm8?  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=775776&page=6
[20:53] <op3c2d2r> robo, that is awesome for froyo!  is it just for the international version or all versions of the SGS?
[20:54] <oskariunit> op3c2d2r: dunno about us or google navi but with jm2 I was off ~200-400m and now its pin point accurate (google maps)
[20:54] <robo> op3c2d2r i have no idea, just a rumor though dont keep any hopes , even if there is froyo, not sure about the gps fix too
[20:54] <oskariunit> op3c2d2r: as we dont have google navi :p
[20:55] <op3c2d2r> oskariunit, what do you have on your SGS?  Don't tell me it's Bing/////
[20:56] <oskariunit> its google maps
[20:56] <oskariunit> but dunno how accurate or how well google navi works as i've never tried it :p
[20:56] <op3c2d2r> robo, well if Samsung at least releases the Froyo source for the SGS, we can take a crack at installing it ourselves
[20:56] <oskariunit> but google maps without navi works fine and much better with latest jm8
[20:57] <op3c2d2r> oskariunit, you have the international version ?
[20:57] <robo> op3c2d2r yes they will release, the date no one knows lol...
[20:57] <op3c2d2r> of SGS?
[20:57] <oskariunit> op3c2d2r: yeah
[20:58] <op3c2d2r> oskariunit, i did not know that google nav was in the u.s. but not international.
[20:58] <Chainfire> ok so far still running into snags directly patching JPH kernel... stopping for today. laters.
[20:58] <robo> by the way op3c2d2r and oskariunit google navi is included in my phone, but when i use it... it says my country is not supported :) !!! and Galaxy s really has one of the worst gps i ever used. even i dont use gps that often, my omnia 1 16gb and motorola milestone's gps beats SGS gps flat
[20:59] <oskariunit> op3c2d2r: its partial outside us at the moment
[20:59] <oskariunit> but will come in to some EU countries later this year
[20:59] <oskariunit> op3c2d2r: its partial outside US at the moment
[20:59] <oskariunit> maybe now you get it :p

[21:00] <BjH> Wait a sec, google navi does not work everywhere in Europe? So I can consider myself one of the lucky few? :)
[21:01] <oskariunit> BjH: its not complete
[21:01] <op3c2d2r> i think @curio_ or someone was saying that people who applied that leaked gps fix were reporting unbelievable gps performance.
[21:01] <BjH> oskariunit: Oh.
[21:01] <damel> BjH: works for me too
[21:01] <oskariunit> it doesnt have voice navi or the map fixes compas wise etc
[21:02] <oskariunit> if you've used other navigation softwares or hardwares you would know the diffrence
[21:02] <BjH> oskariunit: Actually, I definitely  have voice navi.
[21:02] <oskariunit> you from uk?
[21:02] <damel> um...me too
[21:02] <BjH> Nope, Germany.
[21:02] <damel> France here
[21:02] <oskariunit> uk was included in google navi like in august
[21:02] <oskariunit> dunno about other countries :p
[21:02] <op3c2d2r> oskariunit, yep, got it :)
[21:02] <robo> its included in my phone but not supported how ridiculous?
[21:03] <BjH> I got my phone in September. Updated google maps and it was there.
[21:03] <robo> who else used the leaked gps fix ? where can we get it?
[21:03] <oskariunit> ok, i'm from finland and still waiting it :)
[21:03] <dagb> op3c2d2r: there is an even better gpsfix than what is in jm8?
[21:03] <dagb> because gps in jm8 is way, way better than jf3 already
[21:04] <damel> I did the same thing as BjH...got the phone...did the update...and it was all there
[21:04] <oskariunit> it should get here in later this year, and I honestly thought it was like that with other countires as well ( as I had heard only uk was included in august). but maybe it was germany and france as well

[21:16] <dagb> yes

[21:46] <BjH> How "powerful" is update.zip, anyways? Would it be possible to put several kernels/... into one update.zip and choose them by menu? I.e., put update.zip on phone, enter recovery mode, choose between Voodoo, nilfs2 and stock kernel?
[21:54] <BjH> .oO(Or, better yet: *backup* the stock kernel before changing to another one ...)

[22:33] <op3c2d2r> so what is jm8 doing compared to voodoo's reformatting of RFS to ext4?
[22:34] Action: Unhelpful wasn't aware jm8 did anything about app lag
[22:35] <Unhelpful> but probably "something" would mean a better mmc driver or a better rfs driver, since clearly the problem is an interaction between the two
[22:35] <Unhelpful> you switch either one and you get performance - rfs works fine on stl, another fs on mmc works fine too.
[22:36] <Frd^> i hate javascript
[22:40] <Unhelpful> another thing that can be removed to improve performance. ;)

[23:04] <rafyvitto> hello guys
[23:04] <Riddelah> Question: What's the easiest way to revert the kernel to original condition?
[23:05] <Riddelah> Seems silly that I can't "uninstall" the kernelupgrade easily.
[23:05] <rafyvitto> make a file named disable lagfix
[23:05] <rafyvitto> and place it in the voodoo folder of your sdcard and restart the device
[23:05] <Riddelah> I did that, I still have curiokernel on my phone.
[23:05] <rafyvitto> after that flahs the stock rom of your device
[23:05] <rafyvitto> flash*
[23:05] <Riddelah> Gah! I don't want to do that. I just want to revert the kernel...
[23:06] <rafyvitto> kernels cant be reverted...
[23:06] <rafyvitto> you need to reflash the stock kernel
[23:06] <rafyvitto> using Odin3
[23:06] <rafyvitto> flash it as a CSC
[23:07] <Riddelah> If it can be installed by the fix to begin with howcome the original can't be reverted the same way?
[23:07] <rafyvitto> you dont understand, you flashed a whole new kernel with the voodoo lagfix, replacing your stock one
[23:08] <Riddelah> Yes, without using Odin... Why do I need Odin to get the original kernal back rather than just doing it the same way?
[23:09] <rafyvitto> because no one has been able to build a captivate stock kernel..sources just dont build properly
[23:09] <rafyvitto> so you need to flash it with odin3, which is a kernel dumped from a stock build

[23:10] <Archer> hi all!~
[23:10] <rafyvitto> you can get it here: http://koush.tandtgaming.com//test/kernel-captivate-stock.tar.md5
[23:10] <mikebeecham> is it just me, or do I love my Samsung more than I should? :D
[23:10] <mikebeecham> today's delight....Fruit Ninja on a super amoled screen!!
[23:11] <rafyvitto> no its a 'thing" withing SGS users =]
[23:11] <rafyvitto> we all love our devices :P
[23:11] <Riddelah> I would think it's quite common here ;)
[23:11] <Archer> tried nilfs solution - looks good, but I can't say "it's faster" or "it's slower" than ext4...
[23:11] <Archer> Quadrant score is lower, but overall "feeling" is the same as ext4
[23:12] <rafyvitto> im happy with the ext4 implementation, device is simply 10x faster
[23:12] <Riddelah> Quadrant is bullcrap. :)
[23:13] <Archer> Riddelah, but it's at least some measure tool :)
[23:13] <Riddelah> I don't care about numbers. They allways lie. :)
[23:13] <mikebeecham> i get so sick and tired of all the hype over quadrant
[23:13] <mikebeecham> I had a quandrant score of 900, and one of 2100, and they both felt smooth and lagless
[23:14] <Archer> Riddelah, sure, it's lie! But quadrant show us "more lie" or "less lie" :)))
[23:14] <curio_> Liliniser, well done haha
[23:14] <Archer> hi curio!
[23:14] <mikebeecham> I guess it helps the mathematicians something to talk about, but in the day-to-day use of the handset, the aesthetics differ very little
[23:14] <mikebeecham> hey curio_
[23:14] <curio_> hi ;)
[23:14] <Liliniser> thanks!
[23:15] <Riddelah> It's only useful for comparing dick sizes. My quadrant is bigger than yours... Anyone who hit the 20s knows it's not size that matters, it's how you use it ;)
[23:15] <curio_> you took the time to combine smart solutions :)
[23:15] <op3c2d2r> lol
[23:15] <Archer> curio, why r u not sleeping? ;) Tomorrou is monday, -4 d-day :)
[23:16] <Liliniser> Not a great job though.. All Ive done is modifying your scripts :)
[23:16] <op3c2d2r> d-day?
[23:16] <curio_> Liliniser, lol you're minimizing your effort ;)
[23:16] <Archer> ok, not d-day - f-day! Froyo day! :)
[23:16] <Bumble-Bee> also my birthday
[23:16] <curio_> Liliniser, i hope we won't need to use this approach with High quality sources by Samsung
[23:16] <mikebeecham> are we still on for a 23rd release, do we think?
[23:17] <Liliniser> Hope so! Lol
[23:17] <op3c2d2r> ah, ok F-day
[23:17] <Archer> Bumble-bee, I hope u will have some surprise from big S :)
[23:17] <curio_> Liliniser, but the reality is probably that the a lagfix-only will probably look like what you've done
[23:17] <Riddelah> Liliniser: It's not the size of your effort that counts... It's the thought behind it. And that's not a small thing.
[23:17] <op3c2d2r> the day we get Froyo or the day we get F---ed
[23:17] <mikebeecham> it would be genuinely great to see a decent 2.2 rom on Android, although I would love it even better if I could get an AOSP rom
[23:17] <mikebeecham> AOSP with no lag + working GPS
[23:18] <mikebeecham> sweet!
[23:18] <curio_> Liliniser, immediatly after seeing your post i've thought about methods to automatize completly the installation: 1 update.zip and everything is done based on your current running kernel
[23:18] <op3c2d2r> sigh, working GPS...
[23:18] <Archer> mikebeecham, CM6?

[23:45] <Riddelah> Swedne and central europe is +2

[23:54] <Archer> i've installed 3.0 (no color fix) over a b4 (ext4+color fix)
[23:55] <Archer> Riddelah, btw  it's not a good idea to install it before sleep. U have no time to play with it :) Or you have no sleep time :)
[23:56] <Riddelah> I was considering nilfs though.
[23:57] <Riddelah> I don't need sleep... That's for babies ;)
[23:57] <Archer> don't forget to delete "disable-lagfix" folder before updating :)

[23:57] <Archer> And check if u have enough free space on /sdcard after backuping u actual ROM
[23:58] <Riddelah> I have tons of space. :)
[23:58] <Archer> I did a fresh backup and did't checket it - had a lot of problems :)
[23:59] <Riddelah> Backups just cause problems. I rarely bother.
[23:59] <Archer> Riddelah, u know, it's a good idea to check toilet paper before sitting :)
