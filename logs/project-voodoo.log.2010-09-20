[00:00] <Riddelah> lol, yeah. But I feel it's more like wiping my ass before taking a dump... ;)
[00:01] <Archer> I made a backup just for case if I don't like nilfs
[00:01] <Archer> to be sure
[00:02] <Riddelah> I don't have anything to save... Just app-installation if things go bad, so I'm ok. :)
[00:03] <Archer> Riddelah, lucky you :)
[00:04] <Riddelah> It's not really luck. I'm waiting for my phone to be stable before I start using it too heavily. :)
[00:04] <Riddelah> Been waiting 4 months now.. *sigh*
[00:04] <Archer> hehe :)
[00:05] <Shaun> Archer: why?
[00:05] <Shaun> Milestone was a crippled device, keyboard or not
[00:06] <Archer> Shaun, he just didn't like hardware keyboard after some time using it
[00:06] <Shaun> heh
[00:06] <Shaun> i love swype
[00:06] <Archer> exactly - swype
[00:06] <Shaun> and the massive touchscreen sensitivity of the sgs helps a hell of a lot
[00:06] <Shaun> i can even type using the standard one
[00:07] <Riddelah> I'm gonna love my di-novo when I get froyo installed. Why would I want a built in keyboard? :)
[00:07] <Shaun> with the desire/nexus, the touchscreen resolution was poor so you had to be perfect with hitting the keyd
[00:07] <Shaun> froyo has HID on sgs?
[00:07] <Riddelah> Allegedly so.
[00:07] <Shaun> i didnt notice
[00:08] <Shaun> should have tried when i was playing with it
[00:08] <Shaun> i come back to JM8+Voodoo due to weird market issues when using Ryan's lagfix that went away when i switched to stock, and come back when i switched back
[00:08] <Riddelah> I'm hoping it's not a joke, because I really have been missing it.
[00:09] <Shaun> Riddelah: i'm due upgrade on vodafone so i'll likely be robbing them on day of HD launch
[00:09] <Shaun> Desire HD please, same tariff is fine, just gimmie the phone, no i don't need it showing me or set up, thanks bye *runs from store*
[00:09] <Archer> isn't HD too big? Will it ever fit to the pocket? ;)
[00:10] <Riddelah> I don't think I'll need another phone within the next 3 years or so if they get the SGS in order.
[00:11] <Archer> Riddelah, 3.0 on SGS? ;)
[00:13] <Archer> have to go sleep
[00:13] <Riddelah> Archer: I just want a phone that does what I want it to do. 3.0 will probably be nice, but I wouldn't be very bothered if it doesn't come.
[00:13] <Riddelah> Archer: Nighty then. :)

[02:08] <Venim> or does voodoo not use that
[02:08] <curio_> raspdeep's work, Jac_'s too
[02:08] <Venim> and i'm pretty sure atinm uses your kernel :p
[02:08] <curio_> yes also
[02:08] <Unhelpful> curio_: raspdeep's oc/uv was actually there first
[02:09] <curio_> oh but since, the voodoo talk worked and you share :p
[02:11] Action: Unhelpful wonders how the effort to import user oc/uv is going
[02:12] <curio_> i remember when we both were pissed when raspdeep answered but only to tell half of the infos we needed ^^

[02:19] <Riddelah> Hmmm... curio... Your fix enables/disables simply by connecting the charger... That was a very odd experience :P
[02:19] <curio_> hmm ?
[02:20] <curio_> impossible ^^
[02:20] <curio_> 100% impossible
[02:20] <Riddelah> I added the disable lagfix file, turned off my phone, and when I connected the charger, it executed the script... robot voice and all :)
[02:21] <curio_> ahh
[02:22] <curio_> okay
[02:22] <curio_> that's right
[02:22] <curio_> because you set the disable-lagfix
[02:22] <curio_> yes plugging charger, phone off runs linux
[02:22] <curio_> and each time linux is run, voodoo init does it's job
[02:22] <Riddelah> Then I booted the phone, removed the "disable lagfix" file, typed "reboot recovery" in a terminal and it reapplied ext4 before popping up the recovery screen.. That was kind of annoying, I didn't want that :D
[02:23] <curio_> i could prevent it from running but i don't think that's a prob
[02:23] <curio_> the phone is idle anyway, so why not run long migrations in this moment
[02:23] <Riddelah> Yeah, the charger thing is fine, but on booting to recovery it's annoying.
[02:24] <curio_> well, if you don't want conversions, don't set / remove disable lagfix file
[02:25] <Riddelah> Obviously :P
[02:25] <curio_> but i understand your surprise ;)
[02:26] <curio_> charging mode is just antoher linux app
[02:26] <curio_> unlike Download mode
[02:26] <Riddelah> I was planning to install the nilfs thing, and couldn't have the ext4 active and obviously not have the disable lagfix file either :)
[02:26] <Venim> curio_: so dg figured out how to flash modem with redbend
[02:27] <Riddelah> It turned out to be too much of a hassle. lol.
[02:27] <Venim> /tmp/updates/redbend_ua restore /tmp/updates/modem_jh7.bin /dev/block/bml12
[02:28] <curio_> of course, nothing spectacular :D
[02:28] <Venim> ya
[02:28] <Venim> but you couldn't tell me how to do it :p
[02:29] <Riddelah> couldn't or wouldn't ;)
[02:29] <curio_> oh i must have miss your question sorry
[02:30] <curio_> in don't remember
[02:30] <rafyvitto> err did you guys saw the "fast boot" feature fo the htc desire hd/z...err thats retarded ><
[02:30] <rafyvitto> its like impossible..wtf are they implementing...im intriged to know
[02:31] <Unhelpful> rafyvitto: resume-once-suspend-many possibly?
[02:31] <Unhelpful> erm, strike that, reverse it. :)
[02:31] <Unhelpful> hibernate-once-resume-many
[02:31] <rafyvitto> idk somthing lol
[02:32] <curio_> ahh, the power off is very fast ?
[02:32] <rafyvitto> power on
[02:32] <curio_> well, suspend to disk
[02:32] <curio_> i mean, is the action of powering it of is very fast too ;)
[02:34] <Riddelah> Instant on/Instant off would be a miracle :D
[02:34] <distortedloop> curio_  Vibrant port just in time for my friend's new phone!  Team Voodoo rocks.  :)
[02:34] <rafyvitto> yes yes its fast also
[02:34] <Unhelpful> curio_: the idea w/ a HORM setup is that you have a hibernate image that does not have any dependencies on on-disk data - it can't have any volumes mounted that might change.
[02:34] <rafyvitto> its just retarded fast lol
[02:35] <Unhelpful> such an image can be resumed w/o invalidating it, and then you need only to mount the filesystems. otoh we know that android has a *lot* of things happening after fs mount.. :/
[02:35] <Unhelpful> perhaps it has MRAM for main memory?
[02:36] <curio_> distortedloop, niiiiiiiiice !!
[02:36] <distortedloop> Now he'll never know what a laggy SGS is.
[02:37] <curio_> Unhelpful, yes a ton of services startup at boot
[02:37] <curio_> Unhelpful, that's why i suppose it's a basic suspend to disk
[02:37] <Riddelah> Not very many know that anyway in my experience... Everyone I know with a SGS just look at me as if I'm stupid when I tell them their phone is slow. :)
[02:38] <curio_> Riddelah, that's because they don't know.... yet ^^

[02:39] <Riddelah> curio_: lol, they already know. I just did the view the downloads test in market on my phone to make them aware. ;)
[02:39] <curio_> yes, indiscutable demonstration
[02:41] <Riddelah> Froyo seems to be a bit more annoying for hacks... (at least at the moment)
[02:43] <Venim> because its not officially released
[02:43] <Unhelpful> and i can spam about 5-6 app installs via wifi before it starts to get bogged down.
[02:44] <Riddelah> So if they release it on thursday, the hacks are here by friday then ? ;)
[02:47] <Riddelah> Unhelpful: Try that on JF3 firmware ;)
[02:47] <curio_> Depends on when they release the source
[02:47] <curio_> we can hack without source but it's much less fun
[02:47] <Unhelpful> Riddelah: i'm using captivate jf6. i certainly couldn't do that before tweaking the iosched settings.
[02:47] <Venim> jf6 in the house
[02:48] <curio_> nobody use JF7 ?

[03:13] <rafyvitto> installation aborted can be cause by many things; wrong build.prop, wrong config on the update_script etc etc
[03:13] <distortedloop> ok...I'm mounting now to see if there's a log

[03:16] <distortedloop> damn, this Vibrant is finicky on connecting USB to the Mac as well as my i9k...I thought it was just my i9k.
[03:16] <rafyvitto> there are usb drivers for mac?
[03:17] <distortedloop> I've been adb into the phone already, and had it mounted normal usb mount as well, it's just so finicky on this laptop, have to keep pulling the cord and mount remount sometimes.  mihgt be my mac, but I've heard others with same complaints on i9k

[04:45] <distortedloop> okay, JAC confirms that the update.zip must be flashed from Clockwork recovery, not standard recovery.  Curio_ please indicate this on the website instructions.  Also, I think you have to flash JAC's special init files first (per the xda thread) - if this is going to be linked on project-voodoo web, then all of the required files and instructions need to be on project-voodoo website.

[07:17] <Frd^> just got that search by nick working =))
[07:17] <Frd^> mine first jquery stuff =P
[07:17] <rafyvitto> nice mine is red >;D mah favorite color :P
[07:18] <Frd^> so i need to hardcode it =)
[07:23] <kalpik|web> Frd^: after decompile, just copy the source files into the relevant folders
[07:24] <kalpik|web> and then compile again
[07:24] <kalpik|web> chose "y" for system apk
[07:25] <Frd^> kalpik|web: so if i change some icons do i need to change anything else?
[07:25] <kalpik|web> if you're just changing icons, no..
[07:25] <kalpik|web> if you're adding or removing icons, then you have to edit the XML files

[07:29] <Frd^> too simple =D
[07:31] <kalpik|web> yea :)
[07:32] <DMoult> rafyvitto, hiya
[07:33] <Frd^> let test if i broke mine phone =)
[07:34] <Frd^> reboot recovery =)
[07:34] <Frd^> let see.
[07:38] <rafyvitto> hey, how did your i9k story ended?? got it fixed by the store??

[07:42] <DMoult> rafyvitto, nope, the phones4u store told me i have to give it in to a samsung service centre and they can't do anything
[07:42] <DMoult> they* being the phones4u store
[07:42] <rafyvitto_> crap =/
[07:42] <DMoult> so i'm going to go there later today or tomorrow if i have the time

[07:43] <DMoult> i'm more or less sure that they will have to take it in, play with it for a few days, then resign and give me a replacement
[07:43] <rafyvitto_> damn for the to return the phone to you after you give it to them, its gonna be atleast a month, that blows man =/
[07:43] <DMoult> take a month?
[07:43] <DMoult> wowwww
[07:43] <DMoult> i was hoping a week
[07:43] <DMoult> :/
[07:44] <rafyvitto_> usually thats what it takes
[07:44] <rafyvitto_> but hey i can be wrong =]
[07:44] <DMoult> man, i made so many stupid decisions all leading up to this :P
[07:44] <DMoult> first i play with the pattern lock 30 times in a row
[07:44] <DMoult> then when i access download mode the one time, i decide to reboot it to remove sim/sd card
[07:45] <DMoult> :(
[07:45] <DMoult> oh well
[07:45] <rafyvitto_> ><
[07:45] <DMoult> i feel like i'm back in the dark ages, back on my nokia 5320 :P
[07:45] <rafyvitto_> that one time when u access download mode, would have saved you xD
[07:45] <DMoult> yeah
[07:45] <DMoult> it's weird though
[07:45] <rafyvitto_> but hey it happens, no pain, no gain
[07:45] <DMoult> it's like my phone boots up once into recovery
[07:45] <DMoult> boots up once into download
[07:46] <DMoult> then simply refuses to ever do so again
[07:46] <rafyvitto_> yes thats its indeed very very strange
[07:46] <DMoult> i'm tempted to post a thread on xda bringing attention to this pattern lock bug though
[07:46] <DMoult> simply because it's a critical bug, and it's been left in there by google for over a year now :/
[07:46] <rafyvitto_> hey do it, i y self dint know about it, and im always reading and reading and reading...
[07:46] <DMoult> exactly
[07:47] <DMoult> not just in the sgs forum either because it emcompasses all androids
[07:47] <DMoult> i think it's been there since donut or something
[07:47] <rafyvitto_> i bet since 1.0
[07:47] <rafyvitto_> lol
[07:48] <rafyvitto_> it had it from that build and up
[07:49] <Frd^> kalpik|web: what folder i paste those icons?

[07:50] <kalpik|web> Frd^: yes
[07:52] <Frd^> i get always packed with original icons

[10:08] <knowsnotmuch> hello all
[10:08] <knowsnotmuch> anyone tried the lagfix released with stock jm8 kernel?
[10:08] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: i ded
[10:09] <kalpik|web> *did
[10:09] <kalpik|web> and its SUPER FAST!
[10:09] <kalpik|web> NILFS2 one
[10:09] <knowsnotmuch> ohh ok
[10:09] <knowsnotmuch> and any cons?
[10:09] <kalpik|web> none so far
[10:09] <knowsnotmuch> what about that gc thingee?
[10:09] <knowsnotmuch> ie garbage collector
[10:09] <knowsnotmuch> does it slow things down?
[10:10] <knowsnotmuch> i guess its a kind of a cron job?
[10:10] <kalpik|web> it did slow down a bit a few minutes after i installed the lagfix.. but not noticed anything since then
[10:10] <knowsnotmuch> ohh ok
[10:10] <knowsnotmuch> battery .. wifi?
[10:10] <kalpik|web> all fine
[10:10] <knowsnotmuch> i mean ... does stock kernel make a diff?
[10:10] <kalpik|web> its stock kernel ;)
[10:10] <kalpik|web> yeah
[10:11] <knowsnotmuch> and i think jm8 stock kernel wifi sucks :))
[10:11] <knowsnotmuch> as far as battery is concerned i.e
[10:11] <knowsnotmuch> but nice ... conceptually
[10:11] <knowsnotmuch> way too many options now
[10:11] <kalpik|web> yeah
[10:11] <kalpik|web> i prefer stock to compiled kernels
[10:12] <knowsnotmuch> dont know kalpik|web - i thought i do too
[10:12] <knowsnotmuch> but in principle
[10:12] <knowsnotmuch> i like what curio is gunning for
[10:12] <knowsnotmuch> open source - there ought not to be any diff between stock and compile
[10:12] <knowsnotmuch> if done right
[10:13] <knowsnotmuch> anyway - choice is choice
[10:13] <knowsnotmuch> each has its advantage
[10:13] <knowsnotmuch> will the new fix work with ... say ... jm1 rev3?
[10:14] <kalpik|web> yea
[10:14] <kalpik|web> will work with any eclair firmware
[10:22] <knowsnotmuch> ohh ok
[10:22] <knowsnotmuch> but i guess it will overwrite with stock jm8 kernel
[10:22] <knowsnotmuch> ie stock + patch
[10:22] <knowsnotmuch> for nilfs / ext4
[10:24] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: so any consensus on nilfs? from what i read ext4 still does better on the benchmarks...
[10:24] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: NILFS is much faster in real life..
[10:25] <knowsnotmuch> hmmm ....wonder where that comes from
[10:25] <kalpik|web> NILFS is much better with small files

[10:38] <Madsaki> I'm using the default one
[10:38] <Madsaki> DXJG4
[10:40] <Madsaki> hmmm.. if i do a factory reset now will the lagfix be gone or still around?
[10:40] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: i disable-lagfix then do a factory reset and put it back
[10:41] <knowsnotmuch> why dont you first try to clear the app cache first

[10:42] <knowsnotmuch> -> Manage Applications -> Use Menu to Filter to Show All -> Google Talk - Clear Data / Cache

[10:46] <Madsaki> trying now
[10:46] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: thats interesting - but what about the overhead of continuously building a snaphot
[10:46] <knowsnotmuch> wont that be a battery drain?
[10:47] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: not noticed anything so far
[10:48] <Madsaki> is it natural after u install the lagfix all settings go back to default?
[10:49] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: no its not
[10:49] <knowsnotmuch> it should be as you left it in previous boot
[10:49] <Madsaki> omg -.-
[10:49] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: backed up? :)
[10:49] <Madsaki> ya'
[10:50] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: http://forum.sabayon.org/viewtopic.php?f=86&t=18826&start=10 - see the comment about a third of the way down - Xytovl
[10:51] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: voodoo backs up what you had and copies it back after the fs is converted
[10:52] <knowsnotmuch> so there should be no change if things went ok
[10:52] <Madsaki> so now its better for me to do a factory reset now?
[10:52] <knowsnotmuch> are you sure voodoo got deployed?
[10:52] <knowsnotmuch> hmm
[10:52] <knowsnotmuch> you have a problem with just google account right?
[10:53] <knowsnotmuch> try clearing google talk's cache/data first
[10:53] <knowsnotmuch> that *may* solve it
[10:53] <Madsaki> kernel version 2.6.29 curio@carton #Voodoo_lagfix_3.0
[10:53] <Madsaki> tried
[10:53] <knowsnotmuch> ok...
[10:54] <knowsnotmuch>  you will have to add disable lagfix - reboot and then do a factory reset -> enable-lagfix -> then restore
[10:54] <Madsaki> its deployed right?
[10:54] <knowsnotmuch> yeah - the kernel is curio's
[10:54] <knowsnotmuch> do you have quadrant?
[10:54] <knowsnotmuch> cant tell if the fs has changed from that though
[10:55] <knowsnotmuch> you have to compare quadrant score
[10:55] <knowsnotmuch> or use adb to find out
[10:56] <Madsaki> nope dont know what is quadrant
[10:56] <Madsaki> sorry i'm new to this
[10:59] <Madsaki> to disable the lagfix, I just need to create a disable lagfix folder into the Voodoo folder right?
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: its an app which can tell you what your mobile's benchmark is
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> yes
[10:59] <Madsaki> thank you for answering
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> create the folder
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> reboot
[10:59] <Madsaki> trouble u so much
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> if its ext4 - it will convert to rfs
[10:59] <knowsnotmuch> no problem Madsaki
[11:00] <Madsaki> the app is free? on the market?
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> even if its not ext4 - no problem
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> yes
[11:00] <Madsaki> what name must i search for
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> but i presume you are not able to access market?
[11:00] <Madsaki> ya
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> quadrant ought to find it for you
[11:00] <Madsaki> cant
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> if the score on it is around 1700 easy way of telling the fix went through ok
[11:00] <knowsnotmuch> never mind
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> just disable lagfix
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> reboot
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> you will be on rfs
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> now reboot to factory wipe
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> remove the folder disable lagfix
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> reboot
[11:01] <Madsaki> doing it now
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> you will be on ext4
[11:01] <knowsnotmuch> restore your backup
[11:02] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: read that.. still.. ill maintain that battery life is excellent till now!
[11:02] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: why don't you try it yourself? :)
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: yeah - thats just a post
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> i am trying to look for a benchmark
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> i am sure people did that
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> yeah - i will
[11:02] <kalpik|web> quadrant?
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: o
[11:02] <knowsnotmuch> * no
[11:02] <Madsaki> i hear the female robot voice  XD
[11:03] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: this is which reboot? after wipe or before wipe?
[11:03] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: http://www.blah-blah.ch/Mra/Nilfs2performance
[11:03] <Madsaki> before wipe
[11:03] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: saw that - but thats performance - looking for benchmark on power consumption :)
[11:03] <kalpik|web> haha ok
[11:03] <knowsnotmuch> there is one here - http://dcslab.hanyang.ac.kr/nvramos10spring/documents/20_doc/NVRAMOS-shin.pdf

[11:05] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: relax :)
[11:06] <knowsnotmuch> Madsaki: depends on how much data you have ... its copying all that you had, changing fs and copying them all back
[11:06] <Madsaki> haha
[11:06] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: ok.. getting lags again,, seems garbage collector is running
[11:06] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik|web: i am curious to know how long that lasts
[11:07] <knowsnotmuch> and how often it runs
[11:07] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: over :P
[11:07] <knowsnotmuch> cool!
[11:07] <knowsnotmuch> its just chance that you were using the phone at that moment
[11:07] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: yeah.. chance :P
[11:07] <knowsnotmuch> but it lasted what... 5-10 sec?
[11:07] <kalpik|web> knowsnotmuch: yeah.. 10-15 secs max
[11:08] <knowsnotmuch> thats perfectly fine - all thats left is power - which _seems_ ok

[12:25] <BackfireNL> i need to see if my new update.zip works... i made some modifications to the updater-script to make it work with lot of phones
[12:25] <BackfireNL> it's just a rooting update.zip
[12:25] <BackfireNL> i need to see if it fails or succeeds
[12:26] <BackfireNL> can you check it for me
[12:26] <BackfireNL> http://www.multiupload.com/1WEC9ASK91
[12:26] <kalpik|web> lol.. sure it won't mess up with anything? :P
[12:26] <BackfireNL> nope
[12:26] <BackfireNL> 100% sure
[12:26] <kalpik|web> k
[12:26] <BackfireNL> just roots your phone
[12:26] <BackfireNL> installs su, superuser.apk and busybox
[12:26] <kalpik|web> BackfireNL: my phone is already rooted.. how will i check if it worked?
[12:27] <BackfireNL> wel just see if it doesn't fail :P
[12:27] <kalpik|web> ok :P
[12:27] <BackfireNL> if it gives you an update.zip error in recovery
[12:27] <kalpik|web> ohk
[12:27] <BackfireNL> i edited the getprop attributes

[12:27] <BackfireNL> right now i have 3 diffrent update.zips for various models
[12:27] <BackfireNL> now combined that script into 1
[12:28] <BackfireNL> so i can supply one update.zip for more models
[12:28] <BackfireNL> like 9000b/t/m etc
[12:28] <BackfireNL> lol kalpik
[12:28] <BackfireNL> wait
[12:28] <BackfireNL> i failed :P
[12:28] <BackfireNL> did a typo
[12:28] <BackfireNL> GT-9000 instead if I9000
[12:28] <BackfireNL> 1 moment
[12:29] <kalpik|web> heh ok
[12:29] <BackfireNL> uploading it now
[12:29] <kalpik|web> i was anyway looking at the script :P

[12:30] <kalpik|web> you added this right?

[12:30] <BackfireNL> jep
[12:30] <BackfireNL> all the phones are listed now
[12:30] <BackfireNL> but i'm not sure if the recovery is able to check more than 3 getprop attributes
[12:30] <kalpik|web> hmm.. yeah.. i never flash anything without knowing what its gonna do :P
[12:30] <BackfireNL> you see the typo :P
[12:30] <BackfireNL> i know i respect that
[12:31] <BackfireNL> me neither
[12:31] <kalpik|web> :)

[12:46] <Caze_> Damn I was about to get a heart attack yesterday. Dropped my SGS down the stairs as I took it out from my pocket. I was able to slow it down in mid air before it hit the ground the first time but that damn slippery thing went right through my fingers.
[12:47] <Caze_> My brother was standing a few steps below me and it went right through his fingers as well, so it jumped down all 15 steps.
[12:47] <kalpik|web> :o
[12:48] <Caze_> Luckily though the phone didn't get a single scratch. Not even a slightest mark even on backpanel.
[12:49] <kalpik|web> i had a similar experience
[12:49] <kalpik|web> on day 2!
[12:49] <kalpik|web> i dropped my phone from chest height on the floor (stone floor, not wood)
[12:50] <kalpik|web> it fell with full force, without any obstruction
[12:50] <kalpik|web> but same.. no scratch anywhere :D
[12:50] <Caze_> They're surprisingly sturdy little fellows.
[12:50] <Caze_> Or we both just got lucky. :P
[12:51] <kalpik|web> :D
[12:51] <kalpik|web> mine fell on the edge even!
[12:51] <kalpik|web> bounced a bit, then fell flat.. screen facing down
[12:51] <kalpik|web> i didn't have the heart to pick up the phone and see if the screen is broken or not :P
[12:52] <kalpik|web> imagine this happened on the second day itself! :P
[12:52] <Caze_> I don't wish that even for my enemies. :P
[12:53] <Caze_> If I had any. ^^
[12:55] <Caze_> But yeah, mine kept landing on the steps on its corner and edge and I was sure there was going to be atleast somekind of mark.
[12:56] <Frd^> why curio sleeps so late =)
[12:56] <Caze_> Because he codes all night? ^^
[13:00] <dagb> gorillaglass FTW!

[15:10] <kalpik> curio_: hey!
[15:10] <atinm> hey curio_ - do you intend to put links to the vibrant and captivate ports on project-voodoo.org? or just a link to my download section where I put up my .zips?
[15:11] <atinm> or were you thinking of only putting up things  you built on project-voodoo?
[15:11] <atinm> I ask because I had someone install the international version on captivate and then ask  me why it was 90 degrees off :)
[15:11] <atinm> had to point him to my .zip
[15:12] <Zilch25> yeah there was a guy who did that with the vibrant on friday too
[15:13] <atinm> the number of my downloads has fallen off - but I think that is because SRE (now Cognition) is including it directly
[15:13] heazky (~heazky@193.191.136.212) left irc: Ping timeout: 246 seconds

[15:18] <curio_> yes atinm
[15:19] <curio_> after yesterday's FAIL!, we will need to check some points
[15:19] <Frd^> curio_: you got pm!
[15:19] <curio_> yep
[15:19] <curio_> atinm, first, how are bur reports and feedback
[15:19] <curio_> bug reports
[15:20] warri_netbook (~warri@dhcp209-208.wireless.buffalo.edu) joined #project-voodoo.
[15:20] <distortedloop> yesterday's fail being the vibrant confusion?
[15:22] <Unhelpful> curio_: busybox snapshot has offset support in losetup. also losetup w/ offset works as hoped. also busybox blockdev can be used to replace your usage of sfdisk :)
[15:22] <Unhelpful> shame there's no thumb support in buildroot, could go even smaller ;)
[15:23] riddelah (~micke@c80-216-14-75.bredband.comhem.se) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[15:23] <curio_> Unhelpful, nice:!
[15:24] <curio_> Unhelpful, because the offset is the same based on p2 start for every model
[15:25] <curio_> it can replace mbr switching for ext4 detection
[15:25] <curio_> don't know if it's better or not, but, 'can be done without code duplicating and that's good
[15:26] trigrou (~trigrou@2a01:e35:2eec:ae10:223:14ff:fe0a:6eb0) joined #project-voodoo.
[15:28] <Unhelpful> curio_: would need to detect "classic" voodoo and revert the mbr.
[15:31] <curio_> yeah it's kind of nice for the detection procedure
[15:32] <curio_> especially because you don't have to umount anything to free mmcblk0 and switch of mbr
[15:33] <curio_> Unhelpful, did you tried it already ?
[15:34] shaunRen (~shaunR@204.101.237.196) left irc: Quit: Bye
[15:38] <atinm> curio_: what failure are you talking about?
[15:39] <atinm> I haven't really heard many complaints since v1.6 for captivate was released.
[15:39] <atinm> most seem to be user-error
[15:39] <atinm> ppl installing chains of roms
[15:39] <atinm> so who knows what else get messed up. clean from stock seems to fix the problems.
[15:40] <Zilch25> observing proper install and uninstall procedures I haven't had any issues =P
[15:40] <atinm> the headphone errors that people were having were fixed after installing v1.5a captivate, and then just installing v1.6 captivate.
[15:40] <Zilch25> though as of last night i'm using the reorient + voodoo kernel, but up till then it was vanilla 1.6
[15:40] <atinm> (even tho v1.6 isn't necessary - I just want them to have it clean)
[15:41] <Zilch25> (i need my HSUPA dammit)
[15:41] <atinm> what is the HSUPA fix?
[15:41] <atinm> I think DG is putting it into his Cognition ROM that has my kernel
[15:41] <Zilch25> the I9000 reorient kernel, I9000 derived, but all the stuff specific to the cappy compiled into it
[15:41] <Zilch25> which as a result adds HSUPA support
[15:41] <atinm> and seems to have a second zip attached that is just the HSUPA
[15:42] <atinm> but I haven't looked at it yet
[15:42] <Zilch25> the second zip is probably just the UGJH2 modem.bin
[15:42] <Zilch25> since the stock modem is incapable of HSUPA too
[15:42] <Unhelpful> curio_: i'm working on it. :P
[15:42] <Zilch25> and i dont think you can redbend in a modem.bin
[15:42] <atinm> so wonder how he is doing it
[15:42] <Unhelpful> Zilch25: can't imagine why you couldn't...
[15:43] <Zilch25> well you probably can... i just havent seen it done lol
[15:43] <atinm> tho I think I saw someplace where modem.bin was put in the update.zip and installed
[15:43] <atinm> so it must be allowed - samsung needs to be able to do it that way
[15:43] <distortedloop> how else would an OTA modem update be accomplished?
[15:43] <atinm> yeah.
[15:43] <Zilch25> well yeah, makes sense that it's possible/probable, but i dont think designgears is doing it
[15:43] <atinm> Zilch25: does the reorient kernel have a github?
[15:44] <Zilch25> yeah one sec, ill get it for ya
[15:44] <atinm> because then I could pull in the changes for HSUPA
[15:44] <atinm> I'd like it too :)
[15:44] <Zilch25> http://github.com/xcaliburinhand/I9000_I897_hybrid_kernel
[15:44] <atinm> in fact, I'm going to create a separate branch for Unhelpful's OC and now HSUPA
[15:44] <Zilch25> well the thing is people don't know what limits the HSUPA lol
[15:44] <Zilch25> no one has figured that out yet
[15:44] <Unhelpful> atinm: afaik it's pretty much a straight i9k kernel w/ the orientation fixed?
[15:44] <Zilch25> so this is just an I9000 kernel with the captivate stuff added
[15:44] <atinm> ah :)
[15:45] <Zilch25> also yeah, designgears HSUPA package is just a redbend for modem and I9K reorient kernel
[15:45] <atinm> I see.
[15:45] <atinm> oh well.
[15:45] <Unhelpful> Zilch25: probably why he says you have to use CWM recovery, under stock recovery you get a reboot if you run redbend_ua ;)
[15:45] <atinm> sort of sucky that we don't know what disables HSUPA . .. we have the code! :)
[15:46] <Zilch25> i mean it certainly would be nice if someone could figure out what the limitation is
[15:46] <Zilch25> but at this point, with the I9000 reorient working as well as it does it might not even be worth the extra effort :o
[15:46] <Venim> doesn't anyone have a rogers captivate?
[15:46] <atinm> I guess. The kernels are pretty similar really
[15:47] <Unhelpful> curio_: from wikipedia: "Loop devices have also been utilized in order to provide a way of installing operating systems within files on a hard drive without repartitioning the drive."
[15:47] <atinm> curio_: I have to look into loop devices too for HIPAA compliance stuff
[15:47] <Zilch25> they are... it makes running an I9000 ROM on the captivate a bit easier too
[15:47] <Zilch25> then again everyone seems to be running "Cognition" these days...
[15:47] <atinm> I've been helping DG debug his scripts..
[15:48] <atinm> tho I dont' actually run Cognition :)
[15:48] <atinm> I just installed unleash the beast, did my own stock lock screen on top
[15:48] <Zilch25> I've been running reorient kernel plus UGJH2 modem before it was cool! :(
[15:48] <atinm> since I want to hack the stock lock screen to add samsung's music player to the lock screen
[15:48] <atinm> I miss that from their lock screen
[15:49] <Zilch25> yeah, thats a really nice feature with glasslock
[15:49] <atinm> in my stock lock screen
[15:49] <Zilch25> if you could port it over and somehow make it work with the stock lock you'd be a hero haha
[15:49] <Venim> i like glasslock :/
[15:49] <atinm> Zilch25: what's the link to the Odin package (not one-click)
[15:49] <Zilch25> which odin package?
[15:50] <atinm> I have never tried to install anything but the full stock one-click
[15:50] <atinm> so dont' know how to installed modem etc :)
[15:50] <Zilch25> really? O_o
[15:50] <Venim> samfirmware has them
[15:50] <Zilch25> you've never used standard odin?
[15:50] <atinm> no :)
[15:50] <Zilch25> lol wow... now that's shocking
[15:50] <atinm> I've never gone off JF6
[15:50] <Venim> http://www.multiupload.com/MGEJ5CZLWC
[15:50] <Venim> thats jf6
[15:50] <Venim> stockity stock
[15:50] <atinm> yes. :)
[15:50] <Zilch25> i think he just wants the odin program
[15:50] <atinm> I figured I should develop with that . . .
[15:50] <Venim> i've never gone of jf6 either:p
[15:51] <Venim> Zilch25: o
[15:51] <atinm> so that all bug reports at least come off stock + EXT4
[15:51] <atinm> rather than some combination of things
[15:51] <Venim> http://www.multiupload.com/DLS7TWUVPY
[15:51] <Venim> odin
[15:51] <atinm> thanks.
[15:51] <Zilch25> ah beat me to it Venim haha
[15:52] <curio_> re
[15:52] <atinm> I'm just rebuilding eclair with Java6 instead of Java5 on my linux box
[15:53] <atinm> at work
[15:53] <atinm> since I have to use java6 for other things at work
[15:53] <atinm> had to patch it to make it compile
[15:53] <atinm> but this HSUPA is intriguiing.
[15:54] <atinm> it is something in the kernel, but we don't know what?!
[15:54] <atinm> a simple diff -r wouldn't tell us?
[15:54] <warri_netbook> dg has a update that can be flashed and doesnt break voodoo if you want to take a look at it atinm
[15:55] <curio_> curio_: I have to look into loop devices too for HIPAA compliance stuff < what is that ?
[15:55] <warri_netbook> and it works too
[15:55] <curio_> i mean atinm
[15:55] <Venim> atinm: its the modem and the kernel
[15:55] <Venim> or idk
[15:55] <Venim> the captivate modem doesn't work with i9000 kernel though
[15:55] <Venim> so we cant see which is the actual problem
[15:56] <curio_> why use an I9000 kernel instead of the Captivate one ?
[15:56] <curio_> I9000 kernel is just older
[15:56] <Zilch25> yeah the at&t modem is disabled for HSUPA
[15:56] <Zilch25> so even if you use a kernel that can, the modem wont work
[15:56] <Zilch25> it works in reverse too
[15:57] <Zilch25> if you use a modem that can do it and the captivate kernel you cant as well
[15:57] <curio_> atinm, bases on your report it looks like it's time to release it on project-voodoo !
[15:57] <Zilch25> what happens is you get the speeds, but voice turns off
[15:57] <Zilch25> and all you hear is hissing
[15:57] <atinm> curio_: HIPAA is a US stupid thing.
[15:57] <atinm> well, not stupid. it is for hospitals
[15:57] <curio_> ahhh
[15:57] <atinm> privacy issues. my wife works at harvard medical school, and all email is encrypted and only blackberry and iphone are allowed on the network.
[15:58] <curio_> a protocol to disable modem when you're in an hospital ?
[15:58] <atinm> because everything is encripted.
[15:58] <curio_> oh okay
[15:58] <atinm> encrypted, email, the filesystem
[15:58] <Venim> hmm
[15:58] <Venim> actually
[15:58] <Venim> its the modem
[15:58] <Venim> not the kernel
[15:58] <curio_> what is encrypted ?
[15:58] <curio_> only the communications ?
[15:58] <atinm> curio_: no, modem is fine. but data is encrypted.
[15:58] <Venim> o, zilch already said that :p
[15:59] <atinm> so even if the phone is stolen, it cannot be read.
[15:59] <atinm> unless you know the correct passkey
[15:59] <curio_> ah okay
[15:59] <curio_> that's a nice feature
[15:59] <curio_> and it depends on a kernel module ?
[15:59] <atinm> even her laptop has this.
[15:59] <atinm> the filesystem is encrypted.

[16:00] <curio_> what about GalaxyS status about this feature
[16:00] <atinm> all android is locked out right now
[16:00] <atinm> not allowed.
[16:00] <curio_> ahh okay
[16:00] <atinm> and won't work.
[16:01] <atinm> the email server will not respond
[16:01] <curio_> well if the feature isn't supported, that's logical
[16:01] <curio_> atinm, back to the captivate port :
[16:01] <atinm> and I think even if it can get on the wifi network, it will not be able to see any data on the system.
[16:01] <curio_> your update.zip install throught the standard recovery ?
[16:01] <atinm> curio_: yes.
[16:02] <atinm> signed with test signature.
[16:02] <atinm> from AOSP - not my signature.
[16:02] <curio_> atinm, compared to "vanillia" Voodoo, you added run-parts for init.d stuff and,
[16:02] <curio_> yep
[16:02] <atinm> yes, init.d stuff and init stuff for voodoo.
[16:02] <curio_> okay
[16:02] <curio_> let's go
[16:02] <curio_> :)
[16:03] <atinm> http://github.com/atinm/captivate-voodoo-initramfs/downloads
[16:03] <atinm> v1.6 is the latest.
[16:03] <atinm> the one that everyone who is successful is running.
[16:03] <atinm> Venim: what is the modem - the HSUPA?
[16:03] <Venim> yes
[16:03] <Venim> the captivate kernel allows hsupa
[16:03] <atinm> so just replacing the modem.bin will work?
[16:03] <atinm> oh
[16:03] <Venim> well no
[16:04] <Zilch25> the captivate modem = No HSUPA
[16:04] <Venim> because all the other modems are incompatible with our kernel for voice :p
[16:04] heazky (~heazky@193.191.136.212) left irc: Quit: Computer has gone to sleep
[16:04] <Zilch25> the captivate kernel = HSUPA with HSUPA modem.bin but no voice
[16:04] <Venim> exactly
[16:04] <Zilch25> the UGJH2 modem is compatible with our phones on voice and data bands
[16:04] <atinm> Venim: lol - ok, so it requires both.
[16:04] <Venim> well
[16:04] <Venim> the modem is the problem
[16:04] <Venim> not the kernel
[16:04] <Zilch25> they're both the problem
[16:05] <atinm> ok - backing up. we cannot put in the UGJH2 modem on the captivate kernel?
[16:05] <Venim> you can
[16:05] <Zilch25> I9000 kernel + stock modem = No HSUPA
[16:05] <Venim> you get HSUPA data
[16:05] <Venim> no voice
[16:05] <Zilch25> Captivate kernel + UGJH2 modem = HSUPA and no voice
[16:05] <Venim> Zilch25: if you were able to change the cappy modem
[16:05] <curio_> atinm, does your setup write anything to /system ?
[16:05] <Venim> the captivate kernel will work
[16:05] <Zilch25> so there's a limitation on both sides
[16:05] <atinm> curio_: build.prop
[16:05] <curio_> why ?
[16:05] <Venim> Zilch25: the kernel isn't a problem. it just isn't compatible with other devices' modem
[16:05] <atinm> at the time it was just so I could see at a glance what it was running - not needed now
[16:05] <Venim> s
[16:06] <Venim> thats a separate issue
[16:06] <atinm> since ROMs write over it anyway
[16:06] <Zilch25> which... makes it a problem with the kernel =P  we have to use a non stock kernel in order to have compatibility with other modems
[16:06] <atinm> I can delete it without affecting anything
[16:06] <Zilch25> and since we dont have source for modems... we can only alter the kernel
[16:06] <Venim> i don't think thats a "problem"
[16:06] <Venim> theres 2 issues here
[16:06] <Venim> thats what i'm saying
[16:06] <Zilch25> its by design so it technically isnt a problem... the problem is ours if we want HSUPA and voice lol
[16:06] <Venim> that just happen to be related
[16:06] <curio_> atinm, okay Voodoo policy is to be self-contained. no /system or something else write allowed
[16:07] <Zilch25> the thing is we only have the power to modify the kernel, so the change has to be made in the kernel with a modem substitution
[16:07] <atinm> curio_: that's fine - guess I can just put out v1.7 without the /system/build.prop on it
[16:07] achio1115 (~yaaic@m203-78-33-67.smartone-vodafone.com) joined #project-voodoo.
[16:07] <atinm> will do it later after I have compiled AOSP on my machine
[16:07] <curio_> thx atinm
[16:08] <atinm> (I already started that compile, and don't want to stop it right now :) )
[16:08] <atinm> (and my other cores are being used by other compiles for work :) )
[16:08] <Venim> Zilch25: just because you use something else to fix the problem, doesn't mean what you fix is the problem :p
[16:08] <atinm> Zilch25: so it does require both . . . so again, I need to somehow pull in galaxy s things to enable hsupa?
[16:09] <curio_> atinm, v1.6 is not tagged yet on your github, but is it = master ?
[16:09] <Zilch25> yes, you need both
[16:09] <Venim> atinm: you need to make a cappy kernel compatible with a i9000 modem
[16:09] <Venim> thats the goal
[16:09] <Zilch25> and i know, we can't fix the problem, we can only work around it
[16:09] <Zilch25> its the best you can do without driver source
[16:10] <curio_> atinm, i'v read reports about problem connecting with Kies in kies mode. do you confirm that ?
[16:10] <atinm> curio_: yes - I'll tag it - it is actually the same as v1.3 - the change for v1.6 was in the linux-captivate repo
[16:10] <curio_> ah okay, kernel
[16:10] <atinm> but I should tag both
[16:10] <Zilch25> So I suppose the goal is:  Find what it is in the Captivate source that causes voice incompatibility with a non stock modem
[16:10] <atinm> I'll do it now
[16:11] <atinm> curio_: I have yet to figure out how to use Kies. Zilch25 can you connect?
[16:11] <curio_> atinm, on I9000 Kies work on RFS mode but don't on Ext4 mode
[16:11] heazky (~heazky@193.191.136.212) joined #project-voodoo.
[16:11] <atinm> curio_: I think we might have the same issue on captivate - I have read those problems too, but I thought it was related to how they were setting their USB settings.
[16:11] <curio_> atinm, i guess Kies app on the phone checks that /dev/block/mmcblk0p2 is mounted (which is stupid !!)
[16:11] heazky (~heazky@193.191.136.212) left irc: Client Quit
[16:11] <Venim> kies sucks anyway :p
[16:12] <atinm> curio_: I don't really do anything with windows, so and Kies doens't work with linux or mac
[16:12] <curio_> there were 2 issue
[16:12] <Zilch25> with Kies? yeah Kies works
[16:12] <Zilch25> but you have to have PRECISELY the right version
[16:12] <curio_> the first issue was caused by my old force-enable of adb
[16:12] <Zilch25> and its hard to find since it isnt "Supported" for the Captivate

[16:13] <Ethanfel> hi
[16:13] <curio_> ow ^^
[16:13] <atinm> Zilch25: lol - wait, Kies isn't supported for Captivate?
[16:13] <atinm> officially?
[16:13] <curio_> hi Ethanfel
[16:13] <Zilch25> nope... if you check samsung it says "Coming soon for Captivate"
[16:13] <Ethanfel> curio_: how are you today ? :p
[16:13] <curio_> ok
[16:13] <atinm> lol - so screw it!
[16:13] <Zilch25> even though if you grab the one from the singapore link it runs fine
[16:13] <atinm> :)
[16:13] <curio_> Ethanfel, fine !
[16:13] <curio_> thanx and you Ethanfel
[16:13] <Zilch25> and IDs the device
[16:13] <Zilch25> i think they're just waiting to roll out Kies for when they actually push an update
[16:13] <curio_> fine is mostly used to update firmware, save contacts etc...
[16:14] <Zilch25> yeah... it's bloated and awful
[16:14] <Zilch25> for everything but upgrading
[16:14] <curio_> even if it's useless
[16:14] <Ethanfel> curio_: a car seller try to take too much money that i can afford !
[16:14] <curio_> it's better if it work
[16:14] <atinm> curio_: it isn't supported by samsung for captivate it seems -
[16:14] <atinm> not yet. and Zilch25 - it works with captivate if you use the correct version?
[16:14] <Zilch25> yes, sir
[16:14] <atinm> with captivate voodoo kernel?
[16:15] <Zilch25> it's just a pain to find
[16:15] <curio_> http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SGH-I897ZKAATT
[16:15] <Zilch25> i haven't tried with the voodoo kernel, lemme hook it up
[16:15] <atinm> yeah - you have to check with voodoo kernel, might be an issue.

[16:19] <Zilch25> Yes, it does detect
[16:19] <Zilch25> and works
[16:19] <atinm> and connecting it to my mac would just hang

[16:20] <Venim> mtp just crashes for m

[16:25] <atinm> curio_: we do still have to leave /system/etc stuff, right?
[16:25] <atinm> or does that just get overwritten anyway
[16:26] <curio_> atinm, we don't touch /system

[16:28] <Zilch25> i can test things =P
[16:28] <Zilch25> i can always afford to have my phone crash
[16:28] <Venim> has anyone tried building a captivate kernel with audio files from i9000?
[16:28] <Zilch25> at least while i'm at work
[16:28] <atinm> curio_: and then add asound.conf, e2fsck.conf, mke2fs.conf and mtab in there correct?
[16:29] <curio_> yes, there are here... temporarly
[16:29] <atinm> but when the system boots fully, /system/etc will change?
[16:29] <atinm> and those files will go away?
[16:29] <curio_> atinm, yes. mount stlxx on /system make these file 'disappar' even if they're still in memory
[16:30] <atinm> ok

[16:33] <distortedloop> oh, thanks.  I'll check it out
[16:33] <atinm> Zilch25: and you used some other kies. What is kies anyway - a windows program?
[16:33] <Zilch25> yeah its windows
[16:33] <atinm> I just see MTP on my phone
[16:34] <atinm> and then things just hang there
[16:34] <atinm> on my mac
[16:34] <Venim> i don't use kies or windows
[16:34] <Zilch25> its windows, and you have to set your phone to use Kies
[16:34] <Venim> so w/e :p
[16:34] <Zilch25> otherwise it doesn't show up
[16:34] <curio_> kies is shit, but some people use it to transfert photo, save contacts etc,
[16:34] <atinm> where do I get the program?
[16:34] <curio_> samsung almost reimplemented a complete OS in kies
[16:34] <Zilch25> it really is bloated garbage
[16:34] <Zilch25> lemme see if I can find the download link i used waaaaaay back
[16:34] <atinm> my phone didn't come with any CDs
[16:34] <curio_> or at least a complete desktop
[16:34] <atinm> to install software

[16:36] <atinm> so as far as Samsung US is concerned, it doesn't exist.
[16:36] <Venim> yes
[16:36] <Zilch25> correct
[16:36] <Venim> thats why we have OTA stuff on our phone
[16:36] <Zilch25> US does not support Kies at that time
[16:36] <Venim> curio_: the i9000 doesn't?
[16:36] <Zilch25> *this time
[16:36] <curio_> i9000 never has beedn OTA'ed
[16:36] <Venim> well does it have the stuff in the settings
[16:36] <Venim> the ability to
[16:37] <Zilch25> yeah i doubt the US will be either =P  AT&T will probably just send a text saying "Lol here download Kies, good luck!"
[16:37] <Venim> heh
[16:37] <atinm> they forgot to take out the default to kies from our phones tho
[16:37] <Zilch25> I really doubt AT&T will do OTA... because they're terrible
[16:37] <atinm> so we have to go in and change USB settings.
[16:37] <Venim> Zilch25: but forcing you to windows to update is :(
[16:38] <Zilch25> it is amazing that a carrier that assumes everyone is an Apple user would assume everyone uses windows at the same time eh?
[16:38] <atinm> Zilch25: lol
[16:39] <atinm> curio_: send me what I need to do to have the voodoo version etc. I thought it was just CONFIG_LOCALVERSION in the kernel
[16:39] <atinm> as far as kies goes . . . Venim, if you use what Zilch25 uses for Kies (singapore version?), maybe yours will work too?
[16:39] <atinm> since US phones don't have it at all?
[16:39] <Venim> well no
[16:39] <Venim> MTP crashes on my phone
[16:39] <Venim> it doesn't stay open
[16:39] <atinm> oh.
[16:40] <atinm> lol - wtf.
[16:40] <curio_> atinm, export KBUILD_BUILD_VERSION="Voodoo_lagfix_3.0"
[16:40] <Venim> atinm: i don't need it :p
[16:40] <atinm> changing the kernel does a lightning strike to MTP?
[16:40] <curio_> ok i go.. sunn !
[16:40] <Venim> no
[16:40] <Venim> this happened before

[16:41] <curio_> atinm, yes it makes sense
[16:41] <Zilch25> im sure no one will have their feelings hurt
[16:41] <curio_> if Samsung don't say it's supported => not supported
[16:41] <Zilch25> i only have Kies for the purpose of spoofing it to get firmwares =P
[16:41] <curio_> fresh air !! goo
[16:41] <Zilch25> i think the Captivate folks are better off not even know it exists
[16:42] <atinm> curio_: one last - is it CONFIG_KBUILD_BUILD_VERSION="Voodoo_lagfix_3.0"?

[17:27] <Venim> whats it do
[17:27] <atin-away> nothing, just took out the build.prop file from the install, and changed the version to match what curio_ wants for voodoo
[17:27] <Venim> ah
[17:27] <Zilch25> sure, might have a little delay, testing some things for eugene
[17:28] <atin-away> purely cosmetic really.
[17:28] <Venim> i could, but i'll let Zilch25 do it
[17:28] <Zilch25> lol
[17:28] <atin-away> that's fine. its going to take me a little while to build this thing

[17:46] <Chainfire> Unhelpful the problem is not with the cpio and gzipping and whatever
[17:46] <Unhelpful> oh?
[17:46] <Chainfire> its placing it back into a zImage with all sorts of weird linux tools and that it will actually boot
[17:46] <Chainfire> the last step, so to speak
[17:46] <Unhelpful> dd w/ seek= ?
[17:46] <Chainfire> that doesn't work
[17:46] <Chainfire> internal pointer in the zImage file
[17:46] <Chainfire> have to be found and adjusted
[17:47] <Unhelpful> is your new image larger or smaller than original?
[17:47] <Chainfire> doesnt matter neither will work
[17:47] <Chainfire> only exact same size of gzip'd image file matters
[17:47] <Phlogi> still nobody got a custom rom (like cm) running on the galaxy s? Whats actually the main big problem?
[17:48] <Unhelpful> Chainfire: interesting, apparently dkcldark had it working w/o updating the start/end pointers.
[17:48] <Chainfire> you're mixing two things up
[17:48] <Unhelpful> it may be the kernel you started w/ had the panic on decompression error option enabled, and his didn't.
[17:49] <Chainfire> what dkcldark does is edit the cpio in image and if smaller pads with 0's, that works
[17:49] <Unhelpful> and what you're doing is?
[17:49] <Chainfire> but image has to be gzipped and placed back into zImage ... note zImage, not image
[17:49] <Chainfire> you can do it with rebuilding it if you have a bunch of compilers and toolchains installed

[17:51] <Chainfire> I don't host shit :)
[17:52] <Chainfire> no
[17:52] <Chainfire> and how would that adjust the relevant pointers in zImage ?
[17:52] <Chainfire> have you actually tried this ?
[17:52] <Chainfire> the point is not that it isn't possible, unhelpful, the point is that it requires 11000 steps and 7 gazillion compilers to get done, which I don't like :)
[17:53] <Unhelpful> Chainfire: i haven't, but since Image is newer than other files, it wouldn't be rebuilt, but zImage would.
[17:53] <Unhelpful> iow you'd be using the existing tree to take the same steps that are normally taken when building zImage, except w/ a prebuilt Image.

[18:09] <atin-away> or use a patch to let it work with java6

[18:11] <BackfireNL> jo husq510
[18:11] <BackfireNL> how are you?
[18:11] <husq510> hey backfire!
[18:11] <husq510> good
[18:11] <BackfireNL> have you made some progress on rooting 2.2?
[18:11] <husq510> you?
[18:11] <atin-away> actually, I think the build fails right at the start if you aren't using java5
[18:11] <BackfireNL> fine
[18:12] <curio_sun> i use MobileAP just sonner today and now the connection drops and cpu is stuck with 100% used
[18:12] <husq510> i was playing injection initramfs_data.o
[18:12] <BackfireNL> ok :)
[18:12] <husq510> wondering if i can inject bigger initramfs into stock zimage
[18:12] <husq510> it looks promising
[18:12] <BackfireNL> nice
[18:12] <curio_sun> husq510, that's the main challenge
[18:12] <BackfireNL> if so we can do anything
[18:12] <atin-away> hey Zilch25, Venim - it looks like designgears is just writing the modem.bin using redbend_ua

[18:13] <husq510> curio_sun i think objcopy is our firend then
[18:13] <atin-away> oh, but he is also using another kernel
[18:13] <atin-away> boo.
[18:13] <curio_sun> kalpik, NILFS is too young, i don't have interest in it
[18:13] <kalpik> hmm
[18:13] <atin-away> I just looked on the droid 2
[18:13] <atin-away> it is using ext3
[18:14] <husq510> i think unhelfull is working at smae thing
[18:14] <husq510> isnt he?
[18:14] <atin-away> so we're fine with ext4 - didn't go too far from the norm

[18:14] <atin-away> kalpik: when you say fast - faster than ext4?
[18:14] <husq510> curio, if we can inject that into stock zimage, how will use that
[18:14] <husq510> ?
[18:14] <atin-away> how are you measuring?
[18:14] <kalpik> atin-away: yes.. much faster

[18:15] <kalpik> atin-away: ill give you an example
[18:16] <kalpik> atin-away: i use beautiful widget home weather widget, and with ext4, when I boot the phone, it takes time for the widget to appear.. and it only appears after media scanning is complete..
[18:16] <kalpik> with NILFS media scanning is instant! and i can start using the phone as soon as it boots

[18:17] <curio_sun> nilfs doesn't even have a fsck program yet
[18:17] <atin-away> is it doing fsck?
[18:17] <curio_sun> atin-away, no it's parsing medatata in every sdcards
[18:17] <kalpik> curio_sun: it doesn't need one
[18:17] <curio_sun> if it's instant, it means it's broken
[18:17] <BackfireNL> curio_sun what do you think about RyanZA's native EXT fix for JPH?
[18:17] <curio_sun> lol kalpik
[18:18] <kalpik> curio_sun: lol no.. not THAT instant :P
[18:18] <atin-away> BackfireNL: don't get him started :)
[18:18] <atin-away> he tries not to think of it because it makes him angry :)
[18:18] <curio_sun> kalpik, every fileystem needs a fsck. you're too excited ^^
[18:18] <BackfireNL> lol
[18:18] <kalpik> curio_sun: the whole concept of nilfs is that it takes snapshots, and it restores the last snapshot if there is a problem
[18:18] <kalpik> that
[18:18] <kalpik> that's what i could make out of the bit i read up
[18:19] <kalpik> curio_sun: lol im not excited! in fact I am back to ext4 voodoo right now :P
[18:19] <curio_sun> it't not because it's snapshot filesystem that it's invulnerable
[18:19] <kalpik> sure ofcourse!
[18:19] <curio_sun> and any filesystem needs a fsck when shit append
[18:19] <curio_sun> and... you know.. shit append
[18:19] <kalpik> i never said its a better filesystem than ext4
[18:19] <curio_sun> especially with experimental filesystems
[18:19] <kalpik> i just said its much faster!
[18:20] <kalpik> and i wanted to know if any dev has looked into it seriously!

[18:21] <kalpik> curio_sun | yeah and i never said it wasn't an interesting filesystem, at all
[18:21] <curio_sun> just that i'm not planning to integrate it in any stable version of voodoo before years of proven use ^^
[18:21] <kalpik> contradicting statements eh? :P
[18:21] <kalpik> curio_sun: ok, fair enough :)
[18:21] <kalpik> i was just wanting to know your viewpoints on it, and i got your feedback
[18:21] <kalpik> so thanks for that :)
[18:21] <curio_sun> in filesystems, proven = good
[18:22] <husq510> backfire?
[18:22] <curio_sun> a 25% faster filesystem is not worth it if it's not proven since years
[18:23] <curio_sun> if you gain a few seconds by it's boot speed
[18:23] <kalpik> not just boot speed :P
[18:23] <curio_sun> statistically you'll have much more probability to loose hours to restore backups or troubleshooting it
[18:23] <BackfireNL> husq?
[18:23] <BackfireNL> wzzp?
[18:23] <BackfireNL> ow wait
[18:23] <curio_sun> and ext4's speed is allright
[18:24] <Unhelpful> <Chainfire> how many words does it take to make you understand that i dont want to use the kernel_repack method because it's too cumbersome for my tastes
[18:25] <Unhelpful> srsly? you did not at any point say that, unless it was well before i came in.

[18:27] <curio___> argh
[18:27] <husq510> unhelpfull, did you look how initramfs_data.o got built-in ?
[18:27] <curio___> kalpik, but i'm curious how nilfs performs after days of uptimes and many writes
[18:27] <curio___> the garbage collector part
[18:28] <Unhelpful> curio_: nilfs voodoo is about fourth on my list ;)
[18:28] <kalpik> curio___: exactly what i want to know :)
[18:28] <Unhelpful> first is integrating your "classic" implementation w/ my kernel and other mods, probably second is benchmarking that vs the losetup change we talked about :)
[18:30] <Unhelpful> actually maybe i'll just benchmark loopback raw write vs raw block and go from there ;)
[18:30] <curio___> generally i think there a more productive areas to explore than switching filesystem
[18:30] <curio___> basically you gain... nothing, but if you spend the same time working on another code you'll be able to provide a much better gain for users
[18:31] <curio___> may be the same
[18:31] <Unhelpful> curio_: it's not terribly much time to try it. it's *very* easy to drop into your existing kernel.
[18:31] <curio___> but i know there are still some potential issues with loop under difficuly memory situations
[18:32] <curio___> Unhelpful, is it still unsafe to use swap on loop or not ?
[18:32] <Unhelpful> why would you ever when swap works fine on files?
[18:32] <atin-away> yeah, ext4 is plenty good . . . unhelpful, I am going to start cherry-picking your OC changes to a branch now
[18:32] <curio___> i think some patches had taken care of that some times ago

[18:32] <atin-away> that just plain scares me.
[18:32] <kalpik> uv is nice!
[18:33] <curio___> Unhelpful, it was an example of thing that didn't work well (it was about swap over NFS)
[18:33] <curio___> and using a loop was an alernative, if i remember
[18:33] <Unhelpful> atin-away: so you mean the "oldschool" static version that just add 1.2GHz and 600MHz steps?
[18:33] <Unhelpful> curio_: that's insane, use NBD instead ;)
[18:33] <atin-away> kalpik: yeah, but you also like nilsfs

[18:43] <Unhelpful> the important columns here are the first and third, they are CPU clock in KHz and CPU frequency in mV
[18:43] curio___ (~curio@80.10.46.86) left irc: Quit: br0ken MobieAP
[18:43] <atin-away> higher clock but lower freq?
[18:43] <Unhelpful> sorry, s/frequency/voltage ;)
[18:44] <Unhelpful> tireddamnit ;)
[18:44] <atin-away> yes, I actually meant voltage too :)
[18:44] <atin-away> I knew that.
[18:44] <atin-away> so he is requesting higher clock speed but at a lower voltage.
[18:44] <atin-away> at the top end.
[18:44] <atin-away> and going lower.
[18:44] <kalpik> curio_: i get your point.. you can stop tweeting about it :P
[18:44] <Unhelpful> that in and of itself is not completely absurd
[18:44] <atin-away> kalpik: :)
[18:45] <kalpik> :P
[18:45] <Unhelpful> samsung actually sets voltage over spec for 1GHz
[18:45] <atin-away> ah
[18:45] <Unhelpful> but to go *this* low *by default* on install is a bit mad
[18:45] <Unhelpful> and i don't think many of his users know how to change it :P
[18:45] <atin-away> yeah . . . my phone had trouble staying alive.
[18:46] <atin-away> and given that I was struggling with my own kernel - I abandoned it :)
[18:46] <Unhelpful> my next installer will probably remove his clock and kill-media-scanner scripts on install
[18:47] <Unhelpful> it's pretty much needed because the former overrides the method i'm providing since 1.4 to load user clocks on boot, and the latter will hang w/ a bug i've fixed since 1.4.1
[18:48] <atin-away> back later . . . lunch!
[18:52] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik: still on nilfs? ;)
[18:52] <kalpik> knowsnotmuch: no :P
[18:52] <knowsnotmuch> hahaha
[18:53] <kalpik> knowsnotmuch: im a bit concerned about wear and tear
[18:53] <Unhelpful> kalpik: if anything i'd expect it to have less
[18:53] <kalpik> knowsnotmuch: it was extremely fast though!
[18:53] <kalpik> knowsnotmuch: seriously, give it a try!
[18:53] <knowsnotmuch> i dont know... battery drain worries me
[18:53] <knowsnotmuch> i did try kalpik
[18:53] <kalpik> no battery drain
[18:53] <kalpik> oh ok
[18:54] <knowsnotmuch> then got back to ext4
[18:54] <kalpik> your verdict?
[18:54] <knowsnotmuch> saw my free space at some 100 mb
[18:54] <Unhelpful> knowsnotmuch: you need to run the cleaner daemon.
[18:54] <kalpik> heh
[18:54] <knowsnotmuch> Unhelpful: aint that a bother
[18:54] <Unhelpful> or else that happens, heh.
[18:55] <knowsnotmuch> i think ext4 is fine
[18:55] <Unhelpful> not a huge one, i have an android-native build of it around. ;)
[18:55] <knowsnotmuch> ohh ok
[18:55] <Unhelpful> making that was a huge bother ;P
[18:55] <knowsnotmuch> hahaha
[18:55] <Unhelpful> there are recipes around for how to build native android executables using NDK
[18:56] <knowsnotmuch> Unhelpful: it makes continuous snapshots ... wont that be draining more power?
[18:56] <Unhelpful> and they all have essentially the right idea, but they generally tell you to do the linking step rather manually with -nostartfiles etc and including crt.o
[18:56] <Unhelpful> that works fine until you hit a makefile that uses LDFLAGS while compiling :/
[18:57] <Unhelpful> so i looked at the ndk compiler's specfile, and there's actually a -mandroid flag that make it pick the right libc and startfiles on link. much cleaner.
[18:57] Kees-Jan-at-SGS (~AndChat@82-168-149-199.ip.telfort.nl) joined #project-voodoo.
[18:57] <Unhelpful> then you just add -L and --sysroot options and done.
[18:58] <Unhelpful> knowsnotmuch: do you know how the snapshots work? ;)
[18:58] <knowsnotmuch> i knowsnotmuch Unhelpful
[18:58] <Unhelpful> basically the nilfs filesystem is a continually growing list of everything that has happened to the filesystem
[18:58] <knowsnotmuch> ok...
[18:58] <knowsnotmuch> so 0 + every transaction ever?
[18:58] <Unhelpful> so when you write something, it doesn't ever overwrite old data. it's still doing a write just like it would've had to do anyway, but it's to a new block.
[18:59] <Unhelpful> knowsnotmuch: yes, that's about right, and that's how you ended up w/ 100MB free. ;)

[18:59] <knowsnotmuch> hmmm
[19:00] <Frd^> curio_: do you wanna install news script on eggdrop i got simple one =)
[19:00] <Unhelpful> so the snapshots are essentially free. it's a new way that nilfs2 chose to expose something that already exists in any log-structured filesystem.
[19:00] <Unhelpful> most of them don't really give you any way to *look* at old data from the "log"
[19:00] <knowsnotmuch> ok

[19:01] <knowsnotmuch> dont know - maybe its fud - back to ext4 now :)
[19:01] <kalpik> heh
[19:02] <kalpik> knowsnotmuch: did you feel a speed diff between nilfs and ext4?
[19:02] <Unhelpful> the main concerns w/ a log-structured FS would be fragmentation over time and the possible impact on performance
[19:02] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik: not really...
[19:02] <kalpik> :o
[19:02] <knowsnotmuch> maybe i should have tried tiatnium backup
[19:02] <Unhelpful> but the impact of fragmentation on performance w/ flash should not be large ;)

[19:03] <kalpik> Unhelpful: should it be anything at all?
[19:03] <knowsnotmuch> Unhelpful: and the rate at which much of xda folks keep flashing ... everyone's slate is pretty much clean all the time
[19:03] <kalpik> Unhelpful: access time is zwro on flash!
[19:03] <Unhelpful> kalpik: *zero*? time dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null says you may be wrong ;)
[19:04] <Unhelpful> and that's w/ only forward seeks ;)
[19:04] <kalpik> hmm
[19:04] <kalpik> practically zero? :P
[19:05] <Unhelpful> it's low. i'd be more worried about how much the CPU has to think about where the next block of a file might be.
[19:07] Action: knowsnotmuch is stuck between the idealism of curio_ 's push for custom kernels and the realism of dkcldark's stock kernel
[19:08] Action: Unhelpful has been thinking about how to achieve his user clocks as a loadable module for a stock kernel.
[19:08] <Unhelpful> "but it's work and i don't want to"
[19:09] <knowsnotmuch> :)
[19:09] Action: kalpik slaps Unhelpful with a large smelly trout
[19:09] <kalpik> WORK!
[19:10] <kalpik> ok, i think a large part of the "speed" i noticed with NILFS2 can be attributed to Tayutama's JM8 rom :|
[19:10] <knowsnotmuch> kalpik: lol
[19:10] <kalpik> on this ROM even ext4 is feeling fast (so far)
[19:10] <Unhelpful> kalpik: a *lot* of work. the module would need to include compiled versions of all the functions i changed, and code to patch the existing versions of them to jump to the new ones.
[19:11] <kalpik> Unhelpful: code isn't gonna compile itself!
[19:11] <kalpik> ;)
[19:12] <Unhelpful> kalpik: and it's not gonna be remotely feasible to keep merged w/ my existing code.

[19:42] rafyvitto (~IceChat7@24.139.124.84) joined #project-voodoo.
[19:43] <atin-away> I actually agree with curio_ - that is why I tried to keep my kernel to as close to stock as I could and just add ext4 lagfix
[19:43] <atin-away> if I do anything else, its on a branch separate from voodoo.
[19:43] <atin-away> s/if/when.
[19:43] <knowsnotmuch> atin-away: how do you know your kernel is close to stock?
[19:44] Astralgeist] (~astral@92.90.20.1) joined #project-voodoo.
[19:44] <atin-away> well, mostly because it has very few changes from what samsung released - that's as close as one can do it.
[19:44] <atin-away> without having everything samsung put in
[19:44] <atin-away> since they didn't open every last thing
[19:44] <knowsnotmuch> but even curio_ 's point is - we cannot be sure that the source matches stock
[19:45] <atin-away> yes, and he wants us to basically try to keep to the kernel sources released as much as possible if we call it voodo lagfix
[19:45] <knowsnotmuch> atin-away: that way isnt dkcldark way of actually using a stock kernel a good thing?
[19:45] <knowsnotmuch> yeah - i agree with that idealism
[19:45] <atin-away> I actually don't know what dkcldark is doing - is his the reoriented kernel thing?
[19:46] <knowsnotmuch> dont know the hows - but way i understand it - he does not recompile the kernel from sources - uses stock kernel and maybe the fs is a module?
[19:47] <atin-away> oh ..
[19:47] <atin-away> hmm.
[19:47] <knowsnotmuch> his implementation of nilfs is unfortunately grabbing attention :P
[19:48] <atin-away> hey, the more the merrier I say . . . ppl who want to try it, have at it.
[19:48] <knowsnotmuch> yeah - true :)
[19:48] <damel> Yeah
[19:48] <rafyvitto> he did that for the i9k right? cant remember lol
[19:49] <atin-away> found it - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=786509
[19:49] <knowsnotmuch> atin-away: how he does it: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=777380
[19:49] <atin-away> guess that is what curio doesn't like - he wants voodoo to be what he did, not converting to any filesystem.
[19:50] <knowsnotmuch> yeah
[19:50] <atin-away> oh god - surgery on the zImage.
[19:50] <knowsnotmuch> voodoo = ext4
[19:50] <knowsnotmuch> atin-away: yeah!
[19:50] <atin-away> screw that . . . I'm not that in love with the stock kernel.
[19:51] <atin-away> I actually want to be able to see the source.
[19:51] <Astralgeist]> dkcldark'fix have garbage issue / curio's have battery low life / ryanza sticks with ext2 so...  it seems to be no perfect lagfix right now
[19:51] <atin-away> and do things to it myself . ..
[19:51] <atin-away> Astralgeist]: why do you say it has a battery issue?
[19:51] <atin-away> what version? Galaxy?
[19:51] <rafyvitto> battery low? lol, my battery last exacly the same with or withough voodoo lagfix
[19:52] <knowsnotmuch> Astralgeist]: i dont really think battery life is curio_'s issue - many are on JM8 which has issues with wifi
[19:52] <knowsnotmuch> and maybe a whole lot more we dont know about
[19:52] <atin-away> there should be no battery issue - it is just changing the danged filesystem
[19:52] <atin-away> not doing any "work"
[19:52] <rafyvitto> exacly
[19:52] <Astralgeist]> mmmh
[19:53] <atin-away> it just sits there. if anything, there should be less battery use since RFS was definitely doing crap that EXT4 isn't . . .
[19:53] <Venim> odamn
[19:53] <Astralgeist]> i think i'd open a pandora box lol
[19:53] <atin-away> unless it just had sleep() in there :)

[19:54] <knowsnotmuch> its not voodoo - its black magic :))
[19:54] <Venim> w/o reverting to rfs
[19:55] <atin-away> anything that knows about the EXT4 kernel in the same way that curio_ does should be fine
[19:55] <Venim> hmm cool
[19:55] <atin-away> and if it uses the init.d scripts the way we do.
[19:55] <atin-away> curio_: is not using the init.d scripts.
[19:55] <Venim> o
[19:55] <Venim> ya curio doesn't
[19:55] <atin-away> but I think the reoriented one is.

[20:11] <Venim> and flashes after your kernel
[20:11] <Venim> and says to*
[20:12] <Venim> i guess i could just flash the cognition hsupa.zip and it would work
[20:12] <atin-away> right, if you want HSUPA, then it flashes a different kernel
[20:12] <Venim> yes
[20:12] <atin-away> and I really want to figure out what is different
[20:12] <Venim> but i can just directly flash
[20:13] <Venim> its the audio compatibility
[20:13] <Venim> with the i9000 modem
[20:13] knowsnotmuch (~ashwind@122.174.133.182) joined #project-voodoo.
[20:13] <Venim> thats the reason for the other kernel
[20:13] <atin-away> sound drivers?
[20:13] <atin-away> something else?
[20:13] <Venim> and he patches it to fix the issues that arise when putting it on the captivate
[20:13] <Venim> that i'm not sure of
[20:15] <atin-away> I will do a diff tonight when I'm home
[20:16] <Venim> here goes flashin dg's huspa zip
[20:16] <Venim> w/o the zip part :p
[20:17] <Venim> hmm looks good
[20:17] <Venim> so far
[20:19] <atin-away> meaning you installed what?
[20:20] <Venim> installed what i assume is the reoriented i9000 kernel
[20:20] <Venim> right over yours
[20:20] <Venim> with redbend
[20:20] <atin-away> ok - he installs modem.bin and zImage - both with redbend
[20:20] <Venim> yes
[20:20] <atin-away> I assume they'll just work.
[20:20] <Venim> and i assume that zimage is the reorient kernel w/ voodo
[20:20] <atin-away> if zImage is now also with voodoo.
[20:20] <Venim> oo*
[20:20] <atin-away> I think it is.
[20:20] <rafyvitto-i897> yeh it is
[20:21] <Venim> woot voice works
[20:21] <atin-away> I just want to get to the bottom of what makes that kernel different :)
[20:21] <Venim> its some audio stuff
[20:21] <Zilch25> ooo what did i miss
[20:22] <Venim> find out what the phone uses for audio
[20:22] <Zilch25> jerks here actually expecting me to work at work
[20:22] <Venim> Zilch25: just flashed dg's cognition hsupa over atin-away's kernel
[20:22] <Zilch25> wait so you used atin's kernel with the modem.bin from dg's package?
[20:22] <Zilch25> or did you use his redbend as it is and flash both
[20:22] <Venim> no
[20:23] <Venim> ya flashed both
[20:23] <atin-away> no, he flashed both zImage and modem.bin
[20:23] <atin-away> that should work
[20:23] <Venim> directly without reverting to rfs
[20:23] <Zilch25> oh okay, yeah, that works, its just i9000 reorient + ugJH2 modem
[20:23] <atin-away> since I think he supports EXT4 the voodoo way now
[20:23] <Venim> i thought it was jm7
[20:23] <Venim> eh w/e
[20:23] <Zilch25> nope
[20:23] <Venim> doesn't really matter :p
[20:23] <Zilch25> yeah he used the ol' I9000 kernel + UGJH2 or UGJG8 modem trick
[20:23] <Venim> now does the accelerometer work perfectly
[20:24] <Zilch25> since I9000 reorient integrated voodoo
[20:24] <Venim> yup woot
[20:24] <Venim> can play games
[20:24] <Venim> w/o it flipping out
[20:24] <Venim> i can't remember what i'm missing
[20:24] <Venim> by using this kernel
[20:24] <Zilch25> yup :)  thats what i was running before the voodoo port came, then when reorient added voodoo i switched back again
[20:24] <Venim> like what the normal i9000 breaks
[20:24] <Zilch25> bluetooth is still fubar
[20:24] <Venim> other than sd and accelerometer
[20:25] <Venim> ok, well don't care about bluetooth :p
[20:25] <Zilch25> me either- but some people do :)
[20:25] <Venim> but other than bluetooth its basically fixed
[20:25] <Zilch25> its not even full failure, its just audio
[20:25] <Zilch25> you can still connect with BT
[20:25] <rafyvitto-i897> BT got issues, connectivity?? transfer issues?
[20:25] <Venim> great, external sd mounted to computer
[20:25] <Zilch25> static instead of audio
[20:25] <Zilch25> but you can pair
[20:25] <Venim> no reason not to use this now
[20:26] <Zilch25> i think he even has init.d support
[20:26] <Zilch25> so you can do mobileap if you care about that
[20:26] <Venim> mobile ap starts up
[20:26] <Zilch25> okay, thought so :)
[20:26] <Venim> well the i9000 kernels had no issues with mobileap
[20:26] <Venim> when i was using them
[20:27] <Zilch25> yeah thats true, might not even need the init.d because it's natively supported

[21:09] <atin-away> I don't see wtf is different between the two kernel that would be affecting audio
[21:09] <atin-away> and a lot of stuff that makes me wonder who the galaxy version works on the captivate . . .
[21:09] <atin-away> how
[21:09] <rafyvitto-i897> he replaced the affected sound modules
[21:09] <CaseyG> any ideas on why Voodoo on vibrant only worked after i flashed back to Froyo that does not Brick first?
[21:10] <rafyvitto-i897> he replaced them with captivates proper ones
[21:10] <CaseyG> then went back to stock of coarse before applying
[21:10] <atin-away> ok . . . but since we are already using the proper ones, why would using the modem.bin with HSUPA break it . ..
[21:11] <atin-away> since I'd like to enable HSUPA too - but with native captivate kernel! :)
[21:11] <rafyvitto-i897> hmm good question, im clueless
[21:11] <rafyvitto-i897> =]
[21:12] <rafyvitto-i897> maybe it needs other i9k kernel modules to work propely idk
[21:12] <Kaik541> zilch25 has said he's tried looking for what about the kernel disables HSUPA since even a stock captivate kernel with an HSUPA compatible modem doesn't work
[21:12] <rafyvitto-i897> i think hes online on xda
[21:12] <rafyvitto-i897> maybe you can pm him

[21:17] <Zilch25> sorry, im here just doing work stuff =P
[21:17] <Zilch25> but im back
[21:17] <atin-away> nothing - just trying to figure out the diff between the I9000 and captivate that allows HSUPA with one and not the other.
[21:18] <Zilch25> ive poked around in the kernel looking for the missing HSUPA link, but i dont know what the heck im looking for... so lord knows mor ethan likely i missed it haha
[21:18] <atin-away> and xcaliburinhand just came and lost connection.
[21:18] <Zilch25> its a good question... the thing is, it doesnt stop you from making calls
[21:18] <Zilch25> it just screws up your audio

[21:18] <mickeko> lol, voodoo saved me the trouble of having to factory reset after trying out nilfs :)
[21:18] <Zilch25> its just hissing on the line
[21:19] <Zilch25> so it might be a missing codec of some kind
[21:19] <atin-away> the funny is that Captivate has all these ifdefs for AUDIO_HW_Rev02
[21:19] <atin-away> and KEPLER_AUDIO
[21:19] <atin-away> that I9000 doesn't
[21:19] <atin-away> and one assumes that those were done for a reason!
[21:19] <Zilch25> you'd think haha
[21:19] <atin-away> maybe I need to disable those too :)
[21:19] <Zilch25> i know i was digging through poking through mixer settings and the like
[21:19] <atin-away> and in fact that those were meant to break HSUPA functionality.
[21:19] <Zilch25> but its probably not something that smart
[21:19] <atin-away> hmm...
[21:19] <Zilch25> its probably something crude
[21:20] <atin-away> in fact, that must be it.
[21:20] <atin-away> jeez.
[21:20] <atin-away> I have to see what those configs really do.
[21:20] <Zilch25> awesome, and if you figure it out, give me credit for being too inept to find it, but knowing where to look!

[21:22] <Zilch25> i was bouncing between mixer settings and looking at power control
[21:22] <atin-away> but no one's phone has burst into flames on the I9000 kernel.
[21:22] <Zilch25> because the hissing and such is consistent with what you'd hear if the speaker wasn't powered right
[21:23] <atin-away> a lot of the differences are actually in the power stuff
[21:23] <atin-away> battery and such
[21:23] <Zilch25> but unless they had something set to check the baseband version, or something embedded IN an AT&T baseband they'd have no way for the kernel to know

[23:04] <mickeko> I really think it's an excellent approach.
[23:04] <curio_> Phlogi, do you know YAFFS well ? is Samsung claim that YAFFS is no-so-fast and RFS is faster right or pure marketing bullshit ?
[23:04] <Kaik541> I like the idea of a meta-data focused file system... assuming you remember to actually tag things
[23:06] <mickeko> I would think rfs IS faster than yaffs. It's basic KISS thinking. Seems like it sucks on blockdevices though. :p
[23:07] <Phlogi> curio_: YAFFS is specifically for NAND flash
[23:07] <mickeko> There was no issues with rfs on the old "move to fast nand"-trick. :)
[23:08] <curio_> Phlogi, yeah i know, but do you know more about YAFFS strong points and potential weakness
[23:08] <Phlogi> curio_: no, but you find everything on their pages :)
[23:08] <curio_> this page it super short ^^
[23:09] <Phlogi> hmm that internal space in the phone is not a nand flash?
[23:09] <mickeko> Do you think it would be faster if we put the OS on yaffs rather than rfs?
[23:09] <curio_> in SGS ?
[23:09] <curio_> mickeko> Do you think it would be faster if we put the OS on yaffs rather than rfs? < good question
[23:09] <curio_> according to Samsung : NO
[23:10] <curio_> Currently, there are a few open-source projects that implement NAND based flash file systems such as JFFS2, YAFFS and YAFFS2. However, they have a limited applicability to brand-new OneNAND flash memory devices that feature advanced technologies to improve performance.
[23:10] <curio_> RFS supports all of the OneNAND flash memory devices in the market and is optimized for those devices. RFS can deliver much better read/write performance compared to the existing solutions.

[23:20] <Phlogi> meego is using btrfs btw
[23:21] <solipsism> Curio: remember how my phone partitioned the external 16gb into a 2gb for phone storage as the internal wasnt mounting
[23:21] <Kaik541> I was going to mention meego using btrfs
[23:21] <Kaik541> it's crazy fast for my netbook
[23:21] <solipsism> Its stuck like that in the new phone
[23:21] rafyvitto-i897 (~IceChat7@24.139.124.84) left irc: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[23:21] <solipsism> So my 16gb is showing up as 12gb instead of 14
[23:21] <solipsism> should i just repartition that through adb
[23:21] <Phlogi> when I look at kernel devices I don't see that 2Gb space... or are these those /dev/stl devices? What are these?
[23:21] <Phlogi> for example: /dev/block/stl11 on /cache type rfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,vfat,llw,check=no,gid/uid/rwx,iocharset=utf8)
[23:21] <curio_> solipsism, you can't. but a computer will do the trick
[23:22] <solipsism> Ill have to use my netbook then... have to isntall paragon i guess
[23:22] <solipsism> thanks
[23:22] <curio_> Phlogi, yeah meego uses btrfs but they make a choice for the future :D btrfs is still not 100% stable about on-disk format (changed recently again?)
[23:22] <mickeko>   /system is also on stl
[23:22] <solipsism> I don't know enough to answer that pholgi, but it was what my first galaxy did after my Nand was screwed
[23:23] <solipsism> it partitioned part of the external the way it would normally do the internal
[23:23] distortedloop (~dave@206.29.188.232) joined #project-voodoo.
[23:23] <solipsism> just so it could work. did it automatically after my internal failed
[23:23] <Kaik541> meego still uses ext as a boot partition though
[23:23] <Kaik541> don't know if that has any impact
[23:23] <curio_> solipsism's internal SD : MoviNAND was defective

[23:24] <solipsism> Thats what i meant.. forgot the name movinand
[23:24] <solipsism> i was thinking samnand
[23:24] <Phlogi> hmm I need to find out what thise stl are... look like small partitions, maybe virtual ones
[23:25] <mickeko> They are not virtual
[23:25] <mickeko> They are partitions that technically could have been yaffs :)

[23:28] <Phlogi> STL and BML are independent layers for managing I/O to the NAND devices
[23:28] <Phlogi> mickeko: no
[23:29] <mickeko> They are not part of the 8/16GB cluster for sure.
[23:30] <mickeko> I don't remember what files I was messing about with, but they are clearly not part of mmcblk*
[23:30] <Phlogi> its just samsungs prop solution for flash as it seems
[23:33] <mickeko> There are 16 devices for mmcblk, they are 512MB each. (I assume the 16GB has 32 of them)
[23:34] <mickeko> stl and bml has their own devices. Are you saying they are virtual? Seems pointless to do it that way to me?
[23:34] <Phlogi> mickeko: depends on partitioning I guess
[23:34] <Phlogi> mickeko: its for handling the flash NAND "correctly"
[23:34] Kees-Jan-at-SGS (~AndChat@82-168-149-199.ip.telfort.nl) left irc: Quit: Bye
[23:35] <Phlogi> i.e. wear leveling
[23:35] <Phlogi> and bad blocks
[23:36] <Phlogi> looks like they put pretty much work in it... what a pitty that its not opensource
[23:39] <Unhelpful> Phlogi: there's an in-kernel OSS driver for OneNAND using the standard MTD interface, but tbh i've been a bit afraid to play w/ it ;)
[23:40] <curio_> <mickeko> stl and bml has their own devices. Are you saying they are virtual? Seems pointless to do it that way to me? << stl is read/write, bml is read-only.
[23:41] <curio_> Unhelpful, is this kernl driver already available ?
[23:41] <Unhelpful> curio_: it's in the samsung tree and i think has been around since well before 2.6.293
[23:41] <curio_> it's in Linus' kernel ?
[23:41] <Unhelpful> where'd that 3 come from? :P
[23:41] <curio_> ohh
[23:41] <Unhelpful> but i'm pretty sure it's from mainline. :)
[23:41] <curio_> 2.6.29.3 , makes sense ^^
[23:42] <curio_> Unhelpful, i would fear very much lossing my boot loaders too
[23:42] <curio_> if something goes bad => ew
[23:42] <mickeko> You need a RIFFbox ;)
[23:43] <Phlogi> Unhelpful: ah ok interesting
[23:43] <curio_> Unhelpful, there is a safe way to test it i think
[23:43] <curio_> Unhelpful, using a hand-made ramdisk with adb/usb and a few tools
[23:43] <curio_> Unhelpful, could be fun :D
[23:44] <mickeko> FAmous last words: "this is safe, I think" ;)
[23:44] <curio_> lol i didn't said that ^^
[23:44] <curio_> we don't need OneNAND support to boot the ramdisk
[23:44] <curio_> and we can initialize it later :)

[23:46] <Unhelpful> curio_: i would start by imaging them all from a ramdisk w/ samsung's modules, next i'd want to look @ the device under the linux driver and see if the partitioning is recognized and the segments are the same. and *then* we can talk about formatting it as yaffs or whatever. :P
[23:48] Liliniser_ (~AndChat@cpc4-brig12-0-0-cust542.3-3.cable.virginmedia.com) left irc: Client Quit
[23:48] <mickeko> I need to polish my Linux skills.
[23:48] <mickeko> haven't really been messing about with it the last 5 years... It's a shame.
[23:49] <curio_> Unhelpful, oh yeah there is the YAFFS formating part.. *scary* :)
[23:50] <curio_> oops, i just formatted the boot loader partition as YAFFS
[23:50] <curio_> damn :D
[23:50] <mickeko> Time for open surgery and JTAG wiring ;)
[23:50] <curio_> hahaha
[23:51] <curio_> and.. do we know if this driver is stable.. *at all*
[23:51] <mickeko> We "know" it's slow ;)
[23:51] <mickeko> Samsung says so.
[23:53] <curio_> yeah and we all know RFS FAT + Posix + Journaling is super fast in every condition :D

[23:54] <curio_> the reason why we're all here ^^
[23:54] <curio_> Unhelpful, you almost got me excited with your little story
[23:55] <Phlogi> native ext4 does work already so it should be easy to just change the fs, no?
[23:55] <mickeko> Can't you lagfix market downloads too? Why does it need to take 45 seconds for a download to start? :)
[23:55] <mickeko> Phlogi: Not as easy on the systempartitions.
[23:55] <Unhelpful> curio_: if the mtd partitions the same as the bml/stl, i don't think it's that scary, you're not changing partitioning and you're leaving the BL alone so there's little real risk of bricking.
[23:55] <curio_> Phasmatis, Ext4 is alright on data because it's on a sdcard with hardware wear leveling
[23:56] <Phlogi> mickeko: ah does lagfix it only for data?
[23:56] <curio_> only /data
[23:56] <curio_> <mickeko> Can't you lagfix market downloads too? Why does it need to take 45 seconds for a download to start? :) < sometimes market is slow (network)
[23:57] <mickeko> There's no issue with lag on the /dbdata rfs partition that resides on stl for some reason.
[23:57] <curio_> mickeko, when you adb install an apk, there is never a pause before the install happend
[23:57] <mickeko> curio_: I know. I was trying to be funny ;)
[23:57] <curio_> mickeko, on /dbdata, you write small blocks in sync() : SQLite
[23:57] <curio_> hehe
[23:58] <mickeko> curio_: Yeah, but I moved the data for market there at one point, and it was lightning fast.
[23:58] <curio_> and even if it's not performance champion, RFS is ok on native xsr/fsr/rfs full samsung system
[23:58] <curio_> << /dbdata
[23:58] <curio_> and the rest
[23:59] <curio_> the OneNAND memory chip is also very fast
